Friday, December 12, 6:00 - 8:00 PM, [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1976354978944?aff=oddtdtcreator)\
\
*Jadu’i Book* is a 2025 risograph publication featuring commissioned works by seven Palestinian artists: Basma al-Sharif, Lamia Abukhadra, Saj Issa, rana nazzal hamadeh, Qais Assali, Lama Altakruri, and Amanny Asell Ahmad. Organized and edited by Rami George beginning in April 2022, and printed and published by Many Folds Press, the project emerges amid the ongoing Nakba and the genocide of the Palestinian people.

Celebrate the launch of *Jadu’i Book* on December 12 and pick up a copy of this first edition (150), assembled in solidarity. All proceeds will be donated to the Sameer Project, a Palestinian-led mutual aid initiative supporting displaced families in Gaza.\
