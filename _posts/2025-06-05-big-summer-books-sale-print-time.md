*PRINT TIME*: Thursday, July 10 - Sunday, July 27, 2025\
BIG SUMMER BOOK SALE: Sunday, July 27, 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM

The 4th Annual BIG SUMMER BOOK SALE is almost here! Organized again with our longtime collaborators [FORTUNE](https://printingfortunes.info/) & [Icebox Project Space](https://www.iceboxprojectspace.com/home), the SALE will feature an eclectic mix of local bookstores, print collectives, and artist-run projects—from comics to wearable multiples, from self-published zines to discounted art books—as we celebrate printed matter in its many popular, social, and liberatory forms. \
\
In the lead-up to the sale, we’re co-organizing a month-long exhibition called *PRINT TIME*. The exhibition will feature weekly public programming and workshops focusing on local, community-based print and publishing ecosystems. Schedule to be released soon!

**Location:** Icebox Project Space, 1400 N American St. Phila, PA 19122\

Made possible by the generous support of the Penn Treaty Special Services District and our friends at Fire Museum Presents.
