Join Ulises for a group discussion facilitated by Connie Yu on the essays “Commitment as a Non-Performative" by Sara Ahmed, Andrea Long Chu's rumination in the work "Study in Blue: affect, trauma, event" from  Women & Performance, 2017, and excerpts from the book “The Undercommons" by Fred Moten and Stefano Harney.. [RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/227155514510749/) The readings are available through the links below.

- [Chu, Andrea Long. "Study in Blue: trauma, affect, event." _Women and Performance_, 27.3, 2017.](https://www.womenandperformance.org/bonus-articles-1/andrea-long-chu-27-3)
- [Moten, Fred, and Stefano Harvey. "The University and the Undercommons." _The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study_, 2013.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g9Rkz28SuuhZPpHPQ2A9aquY0iKEOo5b/view?usp=sharing)

Connie will explore the aporia of learning and teaching in and around institution toward what Sara Ahmed calls a “process of estrangement,” when what is strange about a given, taken, is relieved. Is it a real inertia in publicizing feeling (Chu) or professionalizing labor (Moten & Harney)? 

Connie Yu is a writer living in Philadelphia, moving toward performance and attending to queer domestic labor, representations of the AsAm diaspora, alternate and constricted transmissions of information, the body and what it wears, and how to work from here. They are the Brodsky Gallery Coordinator at the Kelly Writers House, and a teaching artist at Center for Creative Works.
