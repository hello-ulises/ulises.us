**[RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/body-images-zine-re-release-tickets-1304185446779?aff=oddtdtcreator)**

Join us for the re-release of *Body Images: Photography, Technology, and Beauty Culture* by Liz Barr, now in its second printing. The zine explores how photography, editing, and publishing technologies have influenced beauty culture from 1839 through the present day.

In *Body Images*, Liz Barr examines how photo-editing has shaped our perception of ourselves and others. From 19th-century manual retouching to today's beauty filters, she explores whether manipulated images distort reality, if unaltered photos exist, and whether the prevalence of digital photography has worsened our insecurities or broadened our ideas of beauty. Barr provides historical context to these contemporary concerns.

The event will feature readings by Liz Barr (artist, zine-maker, and printer based in Chicago), Maya Arthur (poet living in Philly), and Connie Yu (writer, artist, publisher, and printer based in Philly).
