[Screen o Series ](https://ulises.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58562cf5d1b76bc24d9c433ec&id=8b43ed8377&e=ec5e67d9bd)(S.o.S.) is a bi-monthly film screening and pay-what-you-will fundraising series hosted by artists Greyory Blake, Masina Frank, and Yōsuke Araki. The hosts trade off selecting a feature (max 2hr) and a short (max 30m). This month, they will be screening *Savage Messiah* and *Fist Fight,* with all proceeds being donated to the [New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia](https://ulises.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58562cf5d1b76bc24d9c433ec&id=d1fee3e303&e=ec5e67d9bd). \

*Savage Messiah* (1972), directed by Ken Russell, dramatizes the brief, fervent life of sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and his intense bond with Sophie Brzeska. His life burned fast — he died young in World War I — but through Russell’s lens, his creative spirit feels explosive, demanding, and ferociously alive. The pacing can be exhausting, but exhaustion is the point. Creation is labor.
