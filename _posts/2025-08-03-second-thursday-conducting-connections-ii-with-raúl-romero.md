6:00 PM – 8:00 PM, [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/second-thursday-conducting-connections-ii-with-raul-romero-tickets-1531279772019?utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&utm-medium=discovery&utm-term=listing&utm-source=cp&aff=ebdsshcopyurl)

Join Philadelphia-based sound artist Raúl Romero for Second Thursday late-night gallery hours in Studio 105 at Ray Philly, in partnership with Ulises. Romero will lead visitors through a second iteration of, *Conducting Connections: A Sound Activation,* an activation of his sculpture hosted by the Fabric Workshop and Museum in 2023.\
\
During the experiment, Romero will sonify his sculpture *Sounding Brass* by translating participants' bio data into a real-time soundscape. Visitors will be invited to join hands to create a human circuit and listen as the electrical energy flowing through their conjoined hands is transmitted into and out of the sculpture.\
\
Romero will also be available to answer questions about his solo exhibition, *Sound Check,* starting at 6:00 pm. The participatory sound experiment starts at 6:30 pm and will be offered on a first-come-first-served basis, with a capacity of 15 participants. RSVP is recommended. A second experiment may run after the first if the demand is there.\
\
*Sound Check* features a revolving set of Romero’s inventive sound sculptures, which will be rotated in and out during the exhibition's run from June 21 to August 22, 2025, and displayed alongside a new series of sound pictures. The exhibition restages previously exhibited sculptures in time with the release of two publications featuring Romero’s Onomonopoetics of a Puerto Rican Landscape: “Vaivén 21st-Century Art of Puerto Rico and Its Diaspora”, edited by Teréz Iacovino and José López Serra, and “Nuyorican and Diasporican Visual Art: A Critical Anthology”, edited by Arlene Dávila and Yasmin Ramirez.\
\
*Sound Check* is on view from June 21 – August 22, 2025.
