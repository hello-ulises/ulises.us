For the second installment of Publishing As Practice, [Martine Syms](http://martinesy.ms/) will front as [Dominica](http://dominicapublishing.com/), the publishing imprint founded by the artist in 2011 dedicated to exploring blackness as a reference, marker, and topic. For the duration of the residency, Martine will transform the Ulises space into a shop selling new screen printed apparel and feature select texts, visual materials, and programming produced by the artist and collaborators. Syms will refashion the Dominica and Ulises websites into in a digital storefront and live streaming platform in the style of an online Home Shopping Network. Publishing as Practice: Martine Syms considers the shop as a central aspect of independent publishing—not only a site of commercial transaction, but also a locus of social exchange.

[Martine Syms](http://martinesy.ms/) is an artist and conceptual entrepreneur based in Los Angeles. Syms works across publishing, video, and performance to examine representations of blackness. Her artwork has been exhibited and screened extensively, including presentations at the Museum of Modern Art, Hammer Museum, ICA London, New Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles, and The Studio Museum in Harlem, among other institutions. From 2007-2011 she was the co-director of the Chicago artist run project space Golden Age, and she currently runs Dominica Publishing, an imprint dedicated to exploring blackness in visual culture. She is a faculty member in the School of Art at the California Institute of the Arts.
