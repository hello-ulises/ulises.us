Active Voice considers the voice in relation to listening, language, and political agency through a series of programs, artworks, readings, events, and curated publications from contributors Mark Beasley, Hannah Black, and Steffani Jemison. Active Voice seeks to address the performative and embodied potential of the voice and its ability to reify and limit political and social realities.

## Contributors

### Steffani Jemison

Steffani Jemison presents her 2014 two-channel sound piece, *Same Time*, a reprisal of a speech delivered in 1970 by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton that has been reinterpreted by Brooklyn-based R&B group Sidetrack Boyz as a vocal improvisation. 

### Hannah Black

Hannah Black presents a selection of recent video works – including "Intensive Care/Hot New Track," "Fall of Communism," and "My Bodies" – that consider pop vocals as a space to explore violence, power, and pluralism.
