Book talk with Nato Thompson on his new book,"Culture as Weapon: The Art of Influence in Everyday Life." Thompson is the artistic director of the nonprofit arts organization Creative Time, which commissions and supports socially engaged works of art. 

"Culture as Weapon" is a spirited and insightful examination of how, over the past century, corporations, politicians, nonprofits, and activists alike have embraced the power of creativity to shape public opinion, for good and for ill. Thompson simultaneously investigates the way artists have reacted to this cultural transformation, from Andy Warhol's prescient Pop Art to Dread Scott Tyler's provocative installations to Suzanne Lacy's social interventions. As he puts it, “the world has witnessed the realization of the age-old avant-garde demand that art become part of the everyday.”
