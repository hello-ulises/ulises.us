Bio: Artists’ Canceled Texts and the World Wide Web,
Maryam Monalisa Gharavi in Conversation with Malcolm Harris 

Maryam Monalisa Gharavi’s "[Bio](http://www.inventorypress.com/product/bio)" (Inventory Press, 2018) is a hybrid work that reconfigures canceled text and the World Wide Web. The book captures a span of 365 days during which the artist updated the 160-character “bio” section of her Twitter account each day. While tweets are regularly captured by corporate data storage centers this “bio” section remains the only untraceable and non-archived part of the software’s superstructure. “Bio” ultimately left no record of itself, complicating the normative binaries of online/offline and digital/print. An experiment in erasure, self-deletion, and visibility in the expanded sphere of the net, “Bio” anchors itself in the wider lineage of artists’ canceled texts, but in the age of new data as “soft” power. 

The work featured in the New Museum Triennial anthology, The Animated Reader: Poetry of “Surround Audience” (ed. Brian Droitcour), and is currently on view as a 365-day internet installation at [Contemporary Journal](https://thecontemporaryjournal.org/issues/bio) (ed. Carolina Rito).

Maryam Monalisa Gharavi is an artist, poet, and theorist whose work explores the interplay between aesthetic and political valences in the public domain. Prior publications include a translation of Waly Salomão’s Algaravias: Echo Chamber (Ugly Duckling Presse), nominated for a 2017 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation; the poetry volume The Distancing Effect (BlazeVOX); the artist publication Apparent Horizon 2 (Bonington Gallery); and the chapbook Alphabet of an Unknown City (Belladonna*).
