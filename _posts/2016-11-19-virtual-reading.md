Join Ulises for a reading with artist and writer Hannah Black. Black, a current contributor to the first curatorial season of Ulises, Active Voice, will read via Skype from a selection of her recent writings. 

Active Voice considers the voice in relation to listening, language, and political agency through a series of programs, artworks, readings, events, and curated publications from contributors Mark Beasley, Hannah Black, and Steffani Jemison. As a contributor to Active Voice, Hannah Black presents recent video works on view which consider pop vocals as a space to explore violence, power, and pluralism.
