Welcome to a world of problems, solved.
 
_Love, Optimized_ is a multimedia experience by Object Solutions, a fictional company that envisions the high-tech future of romance—with a dose of dark humor. 

In the _Love, Optimized_ workshop, you become the inventor. Guided by our laboratorians, you partner up and draw blueprints for new technologies to solve everyday love troubles. The afternoon’s inventions become a pop-up show at Ulises, where visitors are invited to imagine the future of love—optimized.

Our aim is to provoke pressing questions about intimacy and innovation. By co-creating a vision of tech-assisted love, we engage in what Anthony Dunne calls “design for debate,” where we move away from thinking about technological _applications_ to technological _implications_. We invite you to consider the possibilities and limitations of a future where intimacy is administered and supervised by consumer products.

_Love, Optimized_ is a partnership between Ernesto D. Morales and Shelly Ronen.
