Join us on Sunday, January 27 from 2–4 pm for an illustrated lecture by Bidoun Senior Editor Michael C. Vazquez focusing on surrealist self-fashioning. [RSVP HERE](https://www.facebook.com/events/1839609066167763/)

The paintings of the Nigerian artist Colette Omogbai provoked extreme reactions in the early 1960s, with their vivid, impastoed colors and violently abstracted figures, which conjoined human and animal, life and death. Vazquez explores the contexts on this lost-found artist—given pride of place in Okwui Enwezoor’s 2016 Postwar exhibition—amid other 1960s surrealists in Nigeria, Lebanon, and the United States.

Michael C. Vazquez is a writer, editor and curator whose primary interests include cultural diplomacy, little magazines, music, intimacy, and food. He is a Senior Editor at Bidoun, an award-winning journal of art, culture, and ideas from the Middle East and elsewhere. Previously he edited Transition: An International Review, a magazine of art and writing about Africa and its many diasporas. He was curator-in-residence for the Delfina Foundation’s inaugural season on “The Politics of Food” and a fellow at the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. He collaborates frequently with the Colloquium for Unpopular Culture at New York University, and with the artistic working groups Electronic Textures and Women on Airplanes.
