Join Ulises for a book launch and conversation for "Àsìkò: On the Future of Artistic and Curatorial Pedagogies in Africa" with the publication's editorial director Stephanie Baptist and designer Nontsikelelo Mutiti.

[Àsìkò](http://www.asikoartschool.org/) is an innovative program started in 2010, by the Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos, Nigeria to redress the frequently outdated or non-existent artistic and curatorial curricula at tertiary institutions across Africa. 

Each year a cohort of approximately 12-15 emerging African artists and curators join an international faculty of practicing artists, art historians, curators and writers, for an intensive thirty-five-day course of study in art and curatorial history, methodologies, and professional development. Moving between models of laboratory, residency, and academy, Àsìkò privileges experimentation over conventional approaches to art making and curatorial inquiry, encouraging participants to workshop ideas, proposals and projects for long-term development and implementation. 

"Àsìkò: On the Future of Artistic and Curatorial Pedagogies in Africa" chronicles six editions of the program: the first two editions having taken place in Lagos, Nigeria and the subsequent four editions in Accra, Dakar, Maputo, and Addis Ababa, the capitals of Ghana, Senegal, Mozambique and Ethiopia, respectively. The publication documents each unique but related iteration and indexes the work and reflections of the more than 70 cultural producers (from 15 African countries) who have participated in Àsìkò from 2010-2016.
