[The School for Temporary Liveness](https://temporaryliveness.org/) is a week-long series of performances, workshops, talks, conversations and new formats for study inhabiting the poetic frame of a school. The School comprises three zones of encounter—The Classroom, The Library, and Study Hall—each of which engage different modes of viewing and participation. 

Ulises will be participating as part of [Study Hall](https://temporaryliveness.org/study-hall), setting up a Reading Room on he 3rd floor and asking you to think about how might the performance of the body inform our understanding of the circulation of books? Ulises invites you to a room for reading and reflection open throughout the duration of the School for Temporary Liveness. Housed within the Study Hall, the reading room will gather texts that inform and extend from the School for Temporary Liveness’s curriculum and participating practitioners.

Ulises will also host a pop-up shop during select hours. Browse a selection of domestic and international titles—including independent art publications and artists’ books—on critical theory, embodied practice, Black radical thought and other concepts key to the School for Temporary Liveness.

The Reading Room is always open. Shop Hours:
Wednesday, Sept. 25, 6–7pm;
Friday, Sept. 27, 6–8pm;
Saturday, Sept. 28, 4–8pm;
Sunday, Sept. 29, 12-4pm;
Wednesday, Oct. 2, 4-8pm.

This school is free and for the public. Anyone can be a student. STL is presented by University of the Arts School of Dance and has been supported by The Pew Center for Arts & Heritage.
