Join us at Ulises to celebrate the release of 3 new zines. "Leap of Faith" by Isaac Tin Wei Lin, "Two Way Mirror" by Clark Mizono, and "The Grand Inquisitor" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky with illustrations by Zoe Axelrod and Geoffrey KixMiller, are the first publications produced by High Tide and we are excited to share them with you.

Isaac Tin Wei Lin explores the realm where representation and buzzing abstraction meet. His surfaces are often densely covered in calligraphic, brushed and hand-drawn patterns that express both the logic and complexity of written language. Cartoon figures, often in the form of cats and dogs, make appearances, sometimes as larger-than-life-size cut-outs covered in pattern themselves. 

Clark Mizono, is an artist and freelance photographer living and working in New York City.

High Tide is an artist-run gallery and project space located in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Through formal exhibitions, performances, workshops and experimental programming, High Tide seeks to maintain a critical dialogue between artists and our local and global communities.
