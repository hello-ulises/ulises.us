For this iteration of *Dear Reader,* join us for a fun and intimate event of collective bookmaking using Kameelah Janan Rasheed's Algorithmic Book Composition (A-B-C) - Kit, produced as part of the Ulises artists' multiples series, *Commodities*.

In the kit, participants will find several “algorithm determiners” such as a die, color wheels, and sides of jenga blocks, used to create a randomized output. Drawing on the history of Black performance and Fluxus scores, A-B-C offers participants a series of algorithms to determine the design, form, content, and distribution of their book composition. Rasheed's selection of publications within the exhibition's reading room will also support the bookmaking process.

In a recent interview with curator Ladi'Sasha Jones for Rasheed's book, *in the coherence, we weep*, Jones asked about Rasheed’s relationship to play to which she responded, "Play, not as something frivolous, but as something that's rooted in a chance, something that's rooted in improvisation . . . You go into play, not knowing what's going to happen. And that's the exciting part. That's the erotic edge of play. . . . I've already seen what the world can offer. I'm trying to see if we can play towards anything else."

*Dear Reader* is a programmatic series that follows the model of an informal book club to delve into Ulises's quarterly reading lists through facilitated workshops, lectures, performances, and screenings.
