K﻿en Lum's project and exhibition, *Klump!*, is on view in Studio 105, August 30 – November 24, 2024. 

"I have always enjoyed wandering through urban spaces, but not in the romantic, privileged, and detached sense of a flaneur. I learn so much from observing others. The details are attractive and elusive, like Walter Benjamin's optical unconscious. I wander out of curiosity for another, but I also wanted to better understand myself to another. I think about what keeps me from knowing them and what keeps others from knowing me. 

The installation work at Ulises combines and holds in tension two contrary artistic impulses.  The white exhibition walls signal an endpoint to art as an uninflected surface that refuses all reference and representation to arrive at a condition of pure aesthetic experience. The small pictures of individuals punctuate the exhibition walls like musical notation.  

The work is part of a series of pieces involving full-figure photographic portraits and text in the form of questions. I often experience a simultaneous engagement and estrangement from my environment. Rather than focusing on typologies, I look for patterns in social formations. While I enjoy life, I also find it emptying. These thoughts swirl in this installation." – Ken Lum

L﻿um's exhibition is part of Ulises’s year-long artists’ multiples series, “Commodities.” As part of his installation Lum has produced a re-imagination of his infamous 1990 billboard "Melly Shum Hates Her Job" as a ceramic mug. This version nods to the 9-5 office, allowing one to sip and think about the larger themes of labor and capitalism and the feeling of being trapped in some way in one's life.
