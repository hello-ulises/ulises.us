“For our first screening, Grey selected Medium Cool (1969), a story about an idiot who tries, but fails, to recognize the affective distance gaps of daily media intervention. Set and filmed during the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests, it's a strangely paced and oddly poetic virité blurring of reality and fiction. Let's ‘bad vibe’ in a cool basement on small, personal tragedies overshadowed by an atmosphere of social unrest within an intricately complicated pressure cooker. It's as equally invigorating as it is heartbreaking — as perplexingly muddled as it is achingly profound. In short, Medium Cool is life itself." — S.o.S
