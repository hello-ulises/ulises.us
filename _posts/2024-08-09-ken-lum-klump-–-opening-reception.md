Opening Reception: Friday, August 30, 6pm – 9pm\
[RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ken-lum-klump-opening-reception-tickets-979351726377)

Ken Lum’s exhibition *Klump!*—the second installment of Ulises’s year-long, three-part artists’ multiples series *Commodities*—opens on August 30, 2024, at Studio 105 at Ray Philly. *Klump!* combines and holds in tension two contrary artistic impulses. The white exhibition walls signify an endpoint to art as an uninflected surface, refusing all reference and representation to arrive at a condition of pure aesthetic experience. Small pictures of individuals punctuate the walls like musical notation.

This work is part of a series by Lum involving full-figure photographic portraits and text in the form of questions. He reflects, “I often experience a simultaneous engagement and estrangement from my environment. Rather than focusing on typologies, I look for patterns in social formations. While I enjoy life, I also find it emptying. These thoughts swirl in this work.”
