Please join Ulises, in partnership with Moore College of Art and Deisgn, for a screening of "The Politics of Intimacy" (Julie Gustafson, 1972, 52 minutes) and "Now" (Lynda Benglis, 1973, 12 minutes) with an introduction by Jesse Pires, Program Curator at International House Philadelphia.

These two feminist works exemplify the intimacy and immediacy of emergent video technologies in the early 1970s. Both videos employ “close-up” framing, a cinematic device that more intimately connects a viewer to an onscreen subject. In "The Politics of Intimacy," various women, representing a wide range of ages and social and economic backgrounds, openly discuss their sexual feelings and behaviors on topics ranging from orgasm to masturbation. The tape unfolds in a manner that resembles a candid conversion not unlike those of women’s consciousness-raising groups from the era. With Now, Benglis intensifies the relationship between viewer and screen as she interacts with various prerecorded versions of herself. The mediated intimacy of the artist speaking across time and space is downright haunting and foreshadows a future where screens and devices would become preferred modes of connection.
