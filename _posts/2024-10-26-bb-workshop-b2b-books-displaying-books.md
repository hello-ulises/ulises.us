Join Ulises and Tufts University Art Galleries (TUAG) for a workshop “B2B, Books displaying Books” with [BB Workshop](https://artgalleries.tufts.edu/events/176-workshop-ulises-x-bb-workshop-gerrit-rietveld-academie-sandberg-instituut), Gerrit Rietveld Academie/Sandberg Instituut in conjunction with the exhibition *[Ulises: Assembly](https://artgalleries.tufts.edu/exhibitions/203-ulises-assembly)* engaging the labor of bookworkers. BB Workshop will convene a workshop engaging discarded materials in guided bookbinding techniques (gluing, stitching, drilling, cutting, pressing, folding, and stapling). Following the production, BB Workshop will facilitate dialogues for book interventions for designated areas, exploring the relationships between books and the spaces they occupy (exhibitions, shelves, libraries).  

**BB** (est. 2008, Amsterdam) is also known as The Bookbinding Workshop at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and Sandberg Instituut (Miquel Hervás Gómez, Ott Metusala, Gersande Schellinx). It is a workspace that affords the production of books and publications in small editions and specific manipulations of paper and cardboard. Next to being a technical workshop, BB also functions as a cross-departmental point in their institutions. They believe publishing is an emancipatory process.
