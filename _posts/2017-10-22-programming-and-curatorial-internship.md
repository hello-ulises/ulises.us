The Ulises intern program offers training and direct experience working in a growing exhibition space and bookstore environment. If you are a college student or recent grad interested in learning more about arts publishing, arts administration, and its intersection with retail, or are considering a career in the arts, we encourage you to apply. The Ulises internship program seeks talented people of all backgrounds—we value diversity of cultures, races and ethnicities, gender expressions, and abilities.

The intern will take on a variety of development and production based roles working alongside Ulises founders to help plan and document events and programming, conduct research, assist in the implementation of upcoming projects, and maintain shop operations. Interns also gain valuable training, skills, and work experience as well as an opportunity to build a network of professional contacts. An interest in artists’ books, curatorial practice, and community involvement is desirable. November 2017 start is preferred. Applicants may apply for one semester (Fall 2017 or Spring 2018) or two (Fall 2017–Spring 2018).
