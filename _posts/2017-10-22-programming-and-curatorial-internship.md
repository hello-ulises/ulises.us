Ulises is seeking talented people of all backgrounds to apply for our Programming and Curatorial Internship. If you are a college student or recent grad interested in learning more about arts publishing or arts administration, and its intersection with retail, or are considering a career in the arts, we encourage you to apply. The internship offers training and direct experience working in a growing contemporary arts space and bookstore environment. 

You will take on a variety of development and production based roles working alongside Ulises founders to help plan and document events and programming, conduct research, assist in the implementation of upcoming projects, and maintain shop operations. As an intern you will also gain valuable training, skills, and work experience as well as an opportunity to build a network of professional contacts. An interest in artists’ books, curatorial practice, and community involvement is desirable. We encourage people of all backgrounds to apply—we value diversity of cultures, races and ethnicities, gender expressions, and abilities. Early November 2017 start is preferred. Applicants may apply for one semester (Fall 2017 or Spring 2018) or two (Fall 2017–Spring 2018).
