Join Ulises for a reading group discussion led by Maria Murphy on Judith Butler's text _Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative_. This session's reading will focus on Chapter 1 of _Excitable Speech_ entitled, Burning Acts, Injurious Speech, found in the link below. 

[Butler, Judith. "Chapter 1." Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative. New York: Routledge, 1997. 43-69.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwPEQQWlPfvacmxaTHFfc3dWc0tRVzFrRWg4Vzhqc2hUalRv) 

As part of the discussion, Maria will perform "The Production of Voice," a short spoken-word piece for voice and voice processor and John Cage's "Aria" (1958), originally written for interpretation by Cathy Berberian. 

Excitable Speech by Judith Butler is included in “Twelve Books & Seven Records: Re-voice,” a presentation of books and albums selected by curator Mark Beasley as his contribution to Ulises’s curatorial season Active Voice. 

Active Voice considers the voice in relation to listening, language, and political agency through a series of programs, artworks, readings, and selected publications from contributors Mark Beasley, Hannah Black, and Steffani Jemison.

Maria Murphy is a PhD candidate in musicology at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research considers the relationship between music technologies and body politics through the work of multimedia artists Laurie Anderson, Yoko Ono, and Karen Finley. In her dissertation, Maria maps how these artists participated in a particular mode of aesthetic activism, which took part in biopolitical shifts concerning the circulation and industrialization of information, the production of healthy and sickly bodies, and the political fictions of gender and sexuality during a precarious time for public health and social hygiene under Ronald Reagan’s administration. Maria is also interested in developing creative spaces for hands-on research. She is the co-founder of Listening (to) Cyborgs: A Media Archaeology Workshop on Sound Technologies (listeningtocyborgs.com).
