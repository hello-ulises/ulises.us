Gather with Brooke O’Harra, Ross Gay, and Heather Love, who will read (briefly) from new works and speak on their shared investments in teaching as a practice of culture making. We'll celebrate the release of *Who Is In the Room? Queer Strategies for Redefining the Role of the Director*, where O'Harra reimagines directing as an artist-driven practice that challenges traditional roles and fosters collaborative creativity.

O’Harra investigates a series of important questions: How do we wrest our work from institutional imperatives of public building and culture building? How can an artist-driven discourse lead us toward the urgencies of artists and their publics in this moment? How do we “make” plays? How do we activate the relationships of making, whether between artists in the rehearsal room or between the production and the audience? Brooke addresses all aspects of the directorial process: reckoning with the script through dramaturgy, working within the rehearsal room, collaborating with other artists, as well as staging and production.
