Ulises is heading west! We’re thrilled to take part in the [LA Art Book Fair 2025](https://laabf2025.printedmatterartbookfairs.org/visit) at ArtCenter College of Design—our first fair beyond the East Coast. We’re bringing a curated selection of our favorite books, artist multiples by Ken Lum and Candice Lin, and plenty of excitement to connect with fellow publishers, artists, and readers.

Find Ulises at booth **B9**—see you there!
