Join Ulises for a screening of a selection from Candice Lin’s Commodities #3 reading/viewing list, *Tropical Malady* (2004) by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, with a brief introduction by curator and writer Anthony Elms. 

About the film: *Tropical Malady* (118 min) directed by independent Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, chronicles the mystical love affair between a young soldier and the country boy he seduces, soon to be disrupted by the boy’s sudden disappearance. Local legends claim the boy was transformed into a mythic wild beast, and the soldier journeys alone into the heart of the Thai jungle in search of him. As Apichatpong has stated: “I believe in the transmigration of souls between humans, plants, animals, and ghosts.”
