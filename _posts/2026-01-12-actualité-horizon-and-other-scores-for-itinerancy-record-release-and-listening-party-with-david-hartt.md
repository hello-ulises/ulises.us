Record Release and Listening Party: Friday, January 23, \
6:00 – 8:00 PM, [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/actualite-horizon-and-other-scores-for-itinerancy-tickets-1979910137519?aff=erelexpmlt)

Join us in celebrating the launch of Actualité, artist David Hartt’s record label, and its first release, Horizon. Hartt will play selections from his personal record collection, accompanied by commentary and reflection alongside long-time collaborator and sound specialist Eugene Lew. The program offers insight into the making of Horizon and Hartt’s broader practice, interweaving musical selections with personal anecdotes to impart the documentary and conceptual elements of his work.

Horizon originated as a film installation created for Skyscrapers by the Roots, a group exhibition presented in 2025 in the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal (MAC) spaces at Place Ville Marie, which examined the legacy of late modernism in architecture. The soundtrack, released as a limited edition of 300 copies on 180-gram vinyl, features compositions by Canadian multi-instrumentalist Joseph Shabason and Toronto-based musician Thom Gill, with performances by vibraphonist and marimbist Michael Davidson, including an interpretation of David Sylvian’s “Quiet Life” (Japan, 1979).
