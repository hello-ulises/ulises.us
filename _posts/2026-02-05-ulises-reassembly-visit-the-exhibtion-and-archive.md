On view January 31st to March 22nd

Reassembly revisits and expands the question that led to our exhibition at Tufts University Art Galleries, Assembly, last year. Turning the question from—What do you do?—this time asking, How do you do it?

Reassembly brings together three independent art publishers: Can Can Press (Mexico City, Mexico), Further Reading (Bandung, Indonesia), and Ruth van Beek (Koog aan de Zaan, Netherlands), whose contributions to Assembly inspired a closer examination of their practices. This new presentation invites visitors to engage with their work to gain insight into the processes, materials, and concepts that shape each practice. 

Exhibited alongside the cataloged Assembly archive, Reassembly extends an ongoing conversation about the labor and care that shape the field of independent art publishing.

The exhibition considers the material, conceptual, and social dimensions of publishing, and the forms of attention, collaboration, and repetition that define the work behind the work. Reassembly invites new ways of engaging with the publishers’ methods, materials, and research, foregrounding the relationship between what we do and how we do it.
