Join us for a book signing and discussion centered around the release of "Faith Wilding’s Fearful Symmetries" (Edited by Shannon Stratton for Intellect Books, 2018). 

In keeping with Wilding's own artworks, this book is a bricolage: memoirs and watercolors sit alongside critical essays and family photographs to form an overall history of both Wilding's life and works as well as the wider feminist art movement of the 1970s and beyond. This collection spans fifty years of Wilding’s artistic production, feminist art pedagogy, and participation in, and organizing of, feminist art collectives, such as the Feminist Art Program, Womanhouse, Womanspace Gallery, and the Woman’s Building. Included are contributions by Faith Wilding, Amelia Jones, Mario Ontiveros, Irinaari Starkhova, Jenni Sorkin, Elizabeth Hess, Mira Schor, Keith Vaughn, Lauren Basing, Shannon Stratton and Daniel Tucker. 

For this event, [Wilding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_Wilding) will engage in a dialogue with former student, Daniel Tucker, following an introduction by Shannon Stratton, curator of Wilding's retrospective, "Faith Wilding: Fearful Symmetries."

[Shannon R. Stratton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_R._Stratton) is an artist, curator, and writer. She cofounded the artist-run organization Threewalls, Chicago, and until recently the William and Mildred Lasdon Chief Curator at the Museum of Arts and Design, New York. 

[Daniel Tucker](https://miscprojects.com/) is an Assistant Professor and Graduate Program Director at Moore College of Art & Design here in Philadelphia.
