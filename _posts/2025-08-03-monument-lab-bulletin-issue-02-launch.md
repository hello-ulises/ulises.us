Join us for Monument Lab's *Bulletin* Issue 02 Launch: An Offering, Brotherly Love & Sisterly Affection for Emmett Till.

This second issue of *Bulletin* is focused on crucial and creative ideas in public art, history, and design. Edited by Monument Lab Senior Curator Yolanda Wisher in partnership with the Emmett Till Interpretive Center’s Daphne R. Chamberlain and Patrick Weems, *Bulletin* Issue 02 riffs on the theme of “Reverence,” coinciding with the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till’s lynching and Mamie Till-Mobley’s courageous acts of bearing witness in publicly mourning her son that spurred the Civil Rights Movement. Hear from contributors, purchase a copy of the issue, and vibe to music from its companion playlist.

Major support for *Bulletin* is provided by the Mellon Foundation.
