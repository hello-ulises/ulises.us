*Publishing as Practice: Hardworking Goodlooking, Martine Syms/Dominica, Bidoun* centers on the work of three contemporary artists/book publishers who have developed fresh ways of broaching the political in publishing.

This book documents a residency program at Ulises—a curatorial platform based in Philadelphia—that explores publishing as an incubator for new forms of editorial, curatorial and artistic practice. Over the course of two years, three participants (Hardworking Goodlooking, Martine Syms/Dominica, and Bidoun) activated Ulises as an exhibition space and public programming hub, engaging the public through workshops, discussions, and projects.

Hardworking Goodlooking is a design and publishing imprint working primarily out of the Philippines. Dominica is an imprint run by artist Martine Syms dedicated to exploring Blackness as a topic, reference, marker, and audience in visual culture. Bidoun, a non-profit organization and magazine, focuses on art and culture from the Middle East and its diasporas. Each organization approached their residency at Ulises in a unique way, bringing a new understanding of what it means to practice publishing.

Edited by Kayla Romberger, Gee Wesley, Nerissa Cooney, Lauren Downing, and Ricky Yanas, *Publishing as Practice* features a preface by David Senior, Head of Library and Archives at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Ulises Carrión’s 1975 publishing manifesto “The New Art of Making Books.” *Publishing as Practice* also includes writing from Clara Balaguer, Hardworking Goodlooking, Martine Syms/Dominica, Bidoun, Lauren Downing, Kayla Romberger, and Gee Wesley alongside interviews, excerpts, and documentation from each residency.
