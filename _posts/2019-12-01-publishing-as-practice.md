Publishing As Practice, a three-part publisher residency designed to explore publishing as an incubator for new forms of editorial, curatorial, and artistic practice. Three experimental art publishers activated Ulises from 2017-19 as an exhibition space and public programming hub, engaging the public through workshops, discussions, and projects.

Residents included [Hardworking Goodlooking](https://www.instagram.com/hardworkinggoodlooking/?hl=en), the publishing arm of Philippines-based, social practice platform The Office of Culture and Design; [Dominica](https://dominica.la/), an imprint run by Martine Syms dedicated to exploring blackness as a topic, reference, marker and audience in visual culture; and [Bidoun](https://www.bidoun.org/), a non-profit organization focused on art and culture from the Middle East and its diasporas.
