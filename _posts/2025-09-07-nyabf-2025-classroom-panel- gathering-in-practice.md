*Gathering in Practice*, with Joshua Duttweiler, Prem Krishnamurthy, Vera van de Seyp, and ULISES at Printed Matter's New York Art Book Fair at MoMA PS1 from 5 - 6pm.

We're excited to participate in this panel exploring how to design more intentional, imaginative, and responsive forms of gathering, drawing from *[A Toolkit for Gathering](https://draw-down.com/products/a-toolkit-for-gathering-1)*—a new publication from Draw Down Books that offers prompts, exercises, and strategies for rethinking how people come together. The book serves as both a practical guide and poetic invitation, encouraging artists, designers, educators, and organizers to reimagine conventional formats. Building on these ideas, the panel shares adaptable tools and strategies that challenge default assumptions about space, time, roles, and structure, inviting the audience into a dialogue about what thoughtful convening can make possible.\

This program brings together Joshua Duttweiler (Riso-Rama), Prem Krishnamurthy (Department of Transportation), Vera van de Seyp (ITERATIONS), and ULISES. Moderated by Kathleen and Christopher Sleboda. Presented by Draw Down Books.
