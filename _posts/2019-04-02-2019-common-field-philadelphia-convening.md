Ulises is proud to announce our partnership with [Common Field](https://www.commonfield.org/convenings/) — a national network of experimental, independent, visual arts organizations and organizers — to bring the annual Convening to Philadelphia, PA from April 25–28, 2019. The Common Field Convening is an itinerant gathering that brings together 500+ local and national arts organizers to explore the state of the field of artists organizations and to share resources, knowledge and methods for artist-led, artist-run, and artist-centered projects, spaces and practices. 

Over the past year, Common Field has worked with Ulises as part of a group of 14 local organizing partners as well as a growing network of 80+ Philadelphia arts organizations and organizers in order to connect the local contexts and conditions with the interests of the national Common Field Network. 

As a platform for gathering the many artist centered organizations, the Convening recognizes the value of their contributions as a critical and central part of the city’s cultural fabric. It builds awareness for these practices that often take place in unique contexts, and serve and represent more diverse communities. Together we understand there is an urgency to gather around issues of social justice and equity, as well as practical needs and tools for many organizations in our network.
