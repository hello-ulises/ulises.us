Please join Ulises for an experimental lecture/book launch by artist and writer [Carmen Winant](http://carmenwinant.com/).

In lieu of a conventional reading or talk, Carmen will deliver a fifteen-minute original script over top of a video that she created — largely looking at the visual content of artists and medical professionals — that acts a compliment to the her book, "My Birth." The performance will probe the ways that we see and do not see the experience of childbirth.

A book of text and image, "My Birth" interweaves photographs of the artist Carmen Winant’s mother giving birth to her three children with found images of other, anonymous, women undergoing the same bodily experience. As the pictorial narrative progresses, from labor through delivery, the women’s postures increasingly blend into one another, creating a collective body that strains and releases in unison.

In addition to the photographic sequence, My Birth—a facsimile of Winant’s own journal—includes an original text by the artist exploring the shared, yet solitary, ownership of the experience of birth. "My Birth" asks: What if birth, long shrouded and parodied by popular culture, was made visible? What if a comfortable and dynamic language existed to describe it? What if, in picturing the process so many times over and insisting on its very subjectivity, we understood childbirth, and its representation, to be a political act?

In 2018, Carmen Winant participated in the group exhibitions Being: New Photography at the Museum of ModernArt, Another Echo at the Sculpture Center (NY), and a yet-to-be-titled show at the Columbus Museum of Art; solo exhibitions will take place at Miller Contemporary (NY), Stene Projects (Stockholm), and Cave (Detroit). Winant regularly contributes to Aperture, Cabinet, Time, The Believer, and Frieze magazines, and is at work on a book about the nature of practice.
