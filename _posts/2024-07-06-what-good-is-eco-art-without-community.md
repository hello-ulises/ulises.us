Join the 8th Eco-Social Series event, “What good is eco art without community?”  with visiting artists Keg de Souza and Alicia Grullon. Building on Grullon’s 2023 Hyperallergic article [“What Good Is Eco-Art Without Community?"](https://hyperallergic.com/840477/what-good-is-eco-art-without-community-creative-time-parallel-walks/ "https\://hyperallergic.com/840477/what-good-is-eco-art-without-community-creative-time-parallel-walks/") This night of presentations brings together two artists, Keg De Souza and Alicia Grullon, to share their work and observations about the field. Join us in welcoming them to Philly and continue the discussion from past Eco-Social events.\
