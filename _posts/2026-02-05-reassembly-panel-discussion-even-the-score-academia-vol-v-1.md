Friday, February 20, 6pm - 8pm [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/reassembly-panel-discussion-even-the-score-academia-vol-v-tickets-1982320856043?aff=oddtdtcreator)

Join us for a panel discussion about artists and educators working in academia with Lindsay Buchman, Kaitlin Pomerantz, Heather Raquel Phillips, Unique Robinson, and Adriana Monsalve; moderated by Kayla Romberger. Co-organized with Ulises: Assembly Archive contributor Homie House Press.

Even The Score, Academia, Vol. V, published by Homie House Press, is a collaboration centered on the flaws and failures of higher education/academia that engages with hope, connection, organizing, and reflection through the experiences of artists/educators and students nationwide. Even the Score is a starting point, a manifesto, and a space to build from our needs and desires for safety within institutions that dehumanize and disregard faculty, staff, and students at many turns. Our hope is that this newspaper guides us towards clarity in a system that is opaque by design.

Panelists: Lindsay Buchman (editor), Kaitlin Pomerantz (contributor), Heather Raquel Phillips (contributor), Unique Robinson (contributor), and Adriana Monsalve (contributor, publisher)
