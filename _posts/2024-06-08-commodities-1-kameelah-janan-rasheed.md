Kameelah Janan Rasheed’s work and life have long been defined not only by sites of publishing but also by the physical and embodied implications of reading. Reflecting upon her time as a former bookshop employee and past collaborator with Brooklyn Public Library, Rasheed notes, “\[I’ve] always wondered what I would do if I could create my own ‘text-space’ – something that is library and bookstore and playspace and and and…” \
\
For this exhibition, Rasheed realizes her ‘text-space’ with a focus on the erotics of play during the reading, writing, and publishing processes. The title is repurposed from a composite text hidden under a railing in Rasheed’s recent exhibition at the KW Institute of Contemporary Art in Berlin, Germany. Taking a nod from the mythological archetype of the trickster, this show offers several scores or invitations for play as a reader, writer, and publisher using dance notation, stagecraft, and randomizers. In conjunction with two artist’s multiples produced as part of the Commodities series, Rasheed has created a reading room that anchors the exhibition, alongside her diagrammatic prints.

Rasheed’s exhibition is part of Ulises’s year-long artists’ multiples series, “Commodities.”
