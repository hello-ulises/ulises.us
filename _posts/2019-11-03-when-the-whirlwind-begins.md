We're excited to be included in [_When the Whirlwind Begins_ at The Anderson Gallery](https://arts.vcu.edu/programs/theanderson/) at Virgina Commonwealth University. The group show, curated by students explores turmoil and disaster, but aslso new love and beginnings. The Anderson Gallery at VCU is an exhibition and program space for the VCUarts community. It supports experimentation, professional development and work across disciplines. Opening Reception: Nov. 8, 6–9pm!
