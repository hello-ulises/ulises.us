Join Ulises and artists Rudy Gerson and Sharon Hayes for an evening of expanded cinema works presented on 16mm film. This event is the first in a series devoted to 16mm and live performance that explores intersections of desire, protest, and projection across time. 

Prompted by Rudy’s *October 8 (After May 1st)* (2024), which occupies a similar form and voice to Sharon’s 2012 print series, *May 1st*, this shared evening features Gerson’s *Hands on Earth (Tuesday May 14 2024)* and a live reading of October 8 *(After May 1st).* Hayes presents a performed version of Gay Power (1971/2007/2012), a collaboration with the Women’s Liberation Cinema and Kate Millett. Gerson and Hayes’s works include projected 16mm film and live reading.

Following the works, there will be time for an informal discussion. 

Rudy Gerson is an artist and educator engaged in practices of looking, searching, and summoning within arenas of memory, social life, and historical inquiry. Through mediums of print, still and moving image, and performance, fragments are held open and potentials quietly offered.

Sharon Hayes is an artist who uses video, performance, sound and public sculpture to expose specific intersections between history, politics and speech, to unspool reductive historical narratives and to re-ignite dormant pathways through which counter-understandings of the contemporary political condition can be formed.
