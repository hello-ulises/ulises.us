[Ulises: Assembly](https://ulises.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58562cf5d1b76bc24d9c433ec&id=becf6ad86f&e=ec5e67d9bd), is a residency and exhibition engaging the labor of bookworkers, asking: “what do you do?” as a means of delving into the printed matters of art publishing today. The result is a sprawling, multi-tiered physical manifestation of labor, friendships, conviviality, and collectivity of bookworkers as a tribute to our chaotic communality.\
\
It involves and begins with an invitation to hundreds of artists, writers, publishers, printers and other makers, to contribute some sort of published work. Our call and assembly project is inspired by Ulises Carrión’s invitation of the same order to send books, "the sort of books that you make," to his Amsterdam-based bookshop Other Books & So in the 1970s.\
\
