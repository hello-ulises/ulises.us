"Will you give a hand to Ban? Do you have a sentiment, do you have class? Let me tell you before you extend yourself that Ban is disgusting. Let me tell you that Ban is a difficult person to love, full of transience. I could tell you things about Ban."

Join Ulises for a reading group discussion and writing session led by Becky Huff Hunter on Bhanu Kapil's book "Ban en Banlieue" —partly a response to Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's murder—which struggles to memorialize the rape of a young Indian girl walking home alone during a race riot. This session will focus on roughly the first half of the book, found in the link below.

Bring a notepad and pen in order to participate in writing exercises that draw upon the book's themes. As the discussion will partly be discussing interpersonal violence, please help us maintain a safe space by being mindful and considerate of others.
