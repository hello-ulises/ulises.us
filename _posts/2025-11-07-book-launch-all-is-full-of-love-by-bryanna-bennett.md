Friday, November 14, 6:00 - 9:00 PM, [RSVP](https://ulises.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58562cf5d1b76bc24d9c433ec&id=81752400ca&e=ec5e67d9bd)\

Join Ulises in partnership with Indie Photo Lab for the launch of *All Is Full of Lov*e by Byanna Bennet, documenting a journey of self-discovery through the natural world via Iceland. The evening will also feature a display of Bennett's first large-scale quilted cyanotype piece, perfectly, imperfect, a love letter to how intertwined physically and spiritually, as well as a special DJ set by kobwe.

Bryanna Bennett is a photographer and vocalist based in Philadelphia whose work explores tender themes of intimacy, vulnerability, and self-discovery through the natural world. Bennett aims to connect to themselves internally and unravel the mysteries of human connection through recent work focused on tactile feeling in the reach towards intimacy within interpersonal relationships by pairing textile arts with their long-held photographic practice. Their latest projects demonstrate this through quilted cyanotypes.\
