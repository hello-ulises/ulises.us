February 11, 2017 through May 14, 2017

In this quarter Ulises considers intimacy through a close-knit constellation of topics ranging from proximity and privacy to love, friendship, sex, and sexuality. Through a series of programs and explorations, Ulises seeks to offer a space for artists, thinkers, and communities of care to discuss and employ affect, empathy, and love-based politics. Engaging notions of inclusion and belonging over a period three months, this season will address and interrogate our role as social and civic participants. Artist Sharon Hayes, scholar Lauren Berlant, and independent publishing imprint Badlands Unlimited provide principal contributions, with additional contributors extending these ideas and communities.
