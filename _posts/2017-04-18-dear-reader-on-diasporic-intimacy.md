"Diasporic intimacy does not promise an unmediated emotional fusion, but only a precarious affection-- no less deep, yet aware of its transience." - Svetlana Boym

Join Ulises for a group discussion facilitated by Jennifer Wilson on Svetlana Boym's article "On Diasporic Intimacy: Ilya Kabakov's Installations and Immigrant Homes."
