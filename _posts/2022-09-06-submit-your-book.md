Ulises is dedicated to artists’ books and independent art publications. We aim to support people who make books and expand the boundaries of what art publishing can be. If you have a publication that you would like Ulises to consider for our shop, please complete the **[Publication Review Form](https://forms.gle/mwYH53GX21UGVbwy6).** 

**Please Note:** 

* Publications are handled on a consignment basis.
* The retail price is split,​ 60​% to the consignor and 40%​ to Ulises. 
* Ulises reviews submissions monthly.​​
* We are only able to respond to publication submissions we intend to stock. 
* ​Submissions will need to include either digital examples or a physical copy​
* ​If you are sending/dropping off a physical copy, you must still fill out the Review Form and your submission will only be considered once the publication is received. ​
* Ulises does not offer pick-up or return service for submissions.​
* Ulises will only consider for review books that have already been published or self-published.
