Sunday, October 19, 2:00 - 4:00 PM, [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/exploring-the-petroplex-boom-and-dust-book-launch-and-conversation-tickets-1751999681209?aff=erelexpmlt)\
\
*Boom and Dust* creators Jason Reed and Barry Stone discuss their new project with Philly-based artist Kristen Neville Taylor and Ulises co-founder Ricky Yanas. The conversation will focus on the limits and possibilities of lens-based representation in a saturated, embattled media field and the implications of imaging extracted landscapes in New Jersey, Texas, and beyond in light of $40 billion in recently granted fossil fuel subsidies, as oil and gas production hits record high in the United States. \
\
*Boom and Dust* depicts a 40-mile stretch of highway between Midland and Odessa, Texas—the backbone of the most productive oil field in the world. Inspired by Ed Ruscha, Reed and Stone photographed the “Petroplex’s” endless mancamps, pumpjacks, and oil outfitters, assembling the images into a 128-panel accordion book that unfolds to 58 feet. A companion soundscape of field recordings and lap steel guitar can be accessed via QR code or limited-edition cassette.\
