Ulises is popping up in a historic lobster shanty on the edge of Little Harbor in Marblehead, Massachusetts. Join us for the opening celebration on Saturday, June 28th​, from 3 pm to ​sunset. Books, art, ​nautical ephemera, drinks, snacks, ocean breeze, and music await.\
\
The Books Shanty revels in the spirit of summer by the sea—​ rowboats, beach towels, salty skin—and celebrates the shanty itself, where generations of lobstermen have gathered.​

**Celebration:** Sat, June 28, 3:00 PM to Sunset (NOTE: ALL OTHER HOURS HAVE BEEN CANCELED) \
**Location:​** Little Harbor, 5 Beacon St, Marblehead, MA​.
