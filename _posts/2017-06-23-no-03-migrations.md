Please join Ulises in celebrating the launch of our third quarterly season, "Migrations," on Saturday, July 1 from 3-7PM. [RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/655994014599294/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A5%2C%22page_id_source%22%3A1129359703814263%2C%22action_history%22%3A[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22main_list%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A1129359703814263%2C%5C%22tour_id%5C%22%3Anull%7D%22%7D]%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D)

“Migrations” considers how artists, thinkers, and whole communities engage narratives of movement and traversal, sanctuary and refuge. Through contributions from artists [Marwa Arsanios](http://www.mor-charpentier.com/artist/marwa-arsonios/), [Tania Bruguera](http://www.taniabruguera.com/cms/), [Banu Cennetoğlu](http://rodeo-gallery.com/artists/banu-cennetoglu/), and [Xaviera Simmons](https://davidcastillogallery.com/artist/xaviera-simmons/), Ulises will explore the poetics of migration and trouble our notions of origin and boundaries.
