"We are all tied to more than one country. The multilaterally shaped phenomenon of migration cannont be solved unilaterally, or else it generates a vulnerable reality for migrants. Implementing universal rights is essential. The right to be inlcluded belongs to everyone."

Join Ulises for a group discussion facilitated by Nora Elmarzouky on two timely essays by artist Tania Bruguera: "Dignity Has No Nationality" and "Migrant Manifesto."

Tania Bruguera, born in 1968 in Havana, is a politically motivated performance artist, explores the relationship between art, activism, and social change in works that examine the social effects of political and economic power. By creating proposals and aesthetic models for others to use and adapt, she defines herself as an initiator rather than an author, and often collaborates with multiple institutions as well as many individuals so that the full realization of her artwork occurs when others adopt and perpetuate it.

Nora Elmarzouky grew up between Egypt and Pennsylvania. With a BA from Tufts University in International Relations, coupled with her studies in Spain, Morocco, and the Czech Republic, her interest in the interactions between humans, culture, identity, and the built environment was enhanced. She is currently supporting alternative Arab spaces, connecting sustainable dots, a Founders Fellow with Impact100, and expanding in.site collaborative in Philadelphia - a collective of designers and researchers working to make urban development and change more participatory and equitable. Additionally, she is managing Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary Project at Swarthmore bringing archives above refugee crises into the contemporary with Syrian and Iraqi refugees and creating art books with artists.
