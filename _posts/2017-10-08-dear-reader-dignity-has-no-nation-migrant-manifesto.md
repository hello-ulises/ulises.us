"We are all tied to more than one country. The multilaterally shaped phenomenon of migration cannont be solved unilaterally, or else it generates a vulnerable reality for migrants. Implementing universal rights is essential. The right to be inlcluded belongs to everyone."

Join Ulises for a group discussion facilitated by Nora Elmarzouky on two timely essays by artist Tania Bruguera: "Dignity Has No Nation" and "Migrant Manifesto."
