Artist, curator, and community organizer Wanda Nanibush joins curator Denise Ryner for a discussion on the values that shape her work in the arts as part of Interstices. An Anishinaabe-kwe image and word warrior from Beausoleil First Nation, Nanibush has been a leading voice in Indigenous curation and cultural organizing. She recently won the Toronto Book Award for Moving the Museum, was awarded The Hnatyshyn Foundation Mid-Career Award for Curatorial Excellence, and is part of the curatorial team for Counterpublic 2026 in St. Louis.

*Interstices* is an ongoing forum led by Denise Ryner, a curator and writer who developed her curatorial practice in academic and non-profit arts organizations in Toronto, Vancouver and Berlin. The series fosters dialogue between artists and curators in collaboration with cultural spaces across Philadelphia where Ryner is now based.
