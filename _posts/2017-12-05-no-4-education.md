“Education” considers the ways non-traditional approaches to learning and instruction by artists, researchers, and organizers can effect social transformation. This quarter, Ulises examines the enduring legacies of self-organized and experimental pedagogies. Ulises will probe the broad, urgent challenges to access, power, and value within and outside educational institutions today. While publications are instruments of both self-directed and institutional learning, Ulises celebrates their radical potential to upend knowledge and challenge understandings.

"Arlington Heights Suite," 2017. Collage on paper, 15 works, 9 x 12 inches.

“Perhaps the greatest fallacy in theories of human communication is that statements have to have a causal correlation, that our innermost anxieties have a standard verbal equivalent, and that we can only explain a experience through the narration of a logical sequences of events. The overwhelming evidence is that there is no final explanation to any incident, no correlations between them, and that our attempts at understanding any given sequence of events are at best provisional and at worst, hopeless.” —[Pablo Helguera](http://pablohelguera.net/2008/02/the-arlington-heights-suite/), 2008

BFAMFAPhD is a collective of artists, designers, technologists, organizers, and educators who work in the intersection of art, technology, and political economy. Concerned about the impact of debt, rent, and precarity on the lives of creative people, BFAMFAPhD asks: What is a work of art in the age of $120,000 art degrees? BFAMFAPhD creates reports, pedagogical tools, and movement syllabi. Find out more at [BFAMFAPhD.com](http://bfamfaphd.com/).

### Dushko Petrovich
"Adjunct Commuter Weekly" was the first magazine to address the lifestyle needs and shared interests of a rapidly growing and increasingly influential demographic. Edited and published by [Dushko Petrovich](http://dushkopetrovich.com/)—who for a number of years commuted to teach at Yale, RISD, and Boston University—the inaugural issue of "Adjunct Commuter Weekly" was created entirely by current and former adjunct commuters. It had it all: news, opinion, interviews, features, fashion shoot, photo essays, games, syllabi, poetry, fiction, personal memoirs and advertisements for products of interest to the adjunct commuter. First published on July 30, 2015 the print publication was shuttered on August 10, 2015, due to the financial and time constraints of the adjunct commuting staff, but the original issue, and newer content were rebranded as ACW, which can be found at www.adjunctcommuterweekly.com.
