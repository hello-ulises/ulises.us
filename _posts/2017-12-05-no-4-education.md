“Education” considers the ways non-traditional approaches to learning and instruction by artists, researchers, and organizers can effect social transformation. This quarter, Ulises examines the enduring legacies of self-organized and experimental pedagogies. Ulises will probe the broad, urgent challenges to access, power, and value within and outside educational institutions today. While publications are instruments of both self-directed and institutional learning, Ulises celebrates their radical potential to upend knowledge and challenge understandings.
