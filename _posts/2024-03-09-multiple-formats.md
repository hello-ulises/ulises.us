Ulises is participating again in Multiple Formats: Contemporary Art Book Symposium and Art Book Fair at Boston University School of Visual Arts. We will have a table at the fair on Saturday the 23rd and will be doing a 5 minute rapid-fire talk about our work on Friday the 22nd. [Multiple Formats](https://multipleformats.cargo.site/About) weaves together conversations about artist books and higher education, pedagogical practices involving artist books, artist advocacy, and artist book distribution, collection, and access.
