Steffani Jemison presents her 2014 two-channel sound piece, "Same Time," a reprisal of a speech delivered in 1970 by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton that has been reinterpreted by Brooklyn-based R&B group Sidetrack Boyz as a vocal improvisation. Her presentation will be followed by a conversation with Steffani and artist David Hartt.
