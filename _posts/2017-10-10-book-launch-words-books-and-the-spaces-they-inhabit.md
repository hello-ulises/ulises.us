Join Ulises for a book launch and conversation celebrating the release of "Words, Books, and the Spaces They Inhabit" (Sternberg Press, 2017) a new publication by Mari Shaw and the first in her series "The Noble Art of Collecting."

Mari will be joined by Sarah Hamerman, an art librarian working at the Whitney Museum and MoMA Libraries, and scholar Jean-Michel Rabaté, Professor of English Literature, Penn.

Sarah will present on the legacy of artists' books and artist Ulises Carrion, the namesake of Ulises bookshop who figures prominently in Shaw's book, while Jean-Michel will speak briefly about Walter Benjamin whose ideas on book collecting are an organizing element in Shaw's publication. 

With examples of unexpected collectors and serendipitous outcomes, Shaw investigates the obscure desires that shape art collecting and the public goodwill that results from it. What was lost when the scrolls in the ancient library of Alexandria were destroyed? How did Catherine the Great’s collecting change the way we think? How do Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com expand our appreciation of books as objects? Though the ways we communicate and live vary, history has been created, recorded, and preserved in writing. Words and the spaces that contain them are crucial to an empathetic understanding of our world.
