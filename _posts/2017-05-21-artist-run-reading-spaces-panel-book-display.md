From 1975 to 1978 in Amsterdam, Ulises Carrión operated Other Books and So, an artist-run bookstore and exhibition space dedicated to artists’ books and ephemera, which served as a key point of interchange between Latin American and European artists’ publishing communities. Drawing upon this example, this discussion brings together the founders of artist-run bookstores, libraries, and reading rooms. Ideas of circulation, access, and “making public” intersect both libraries and experimental publishing practices, and artist-run reading spaces offer alternative ways of actualizing these ideas outside of institutional paradigms. More than distribution points for texts, they function as social spaces of reading. Panelists will join in a 90-minute discussion of their projects, to be accompanied by a casual book display including items selected by the presenters and items from MoMA Library.

Panelists:
Gee Wesley, Ulises, Philadelphia
Rachel Valinsky, Wendy's Subway, Brooklyn, NY
David Richardson, Dispersed Holdings, NYC
Kimi Hanauer & Bomin Jeon, Press Press, Baltimore
Devin N Morris, Brown Paper Zine Fair, 3 DOT ZINE, Brooklyn, NY

Moderator: Sarah Hamerman, Artist Book Cataloger, MoMA Library
