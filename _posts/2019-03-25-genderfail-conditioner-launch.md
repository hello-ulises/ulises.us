Please join Ulises for a publication release and reading event for "Conditioner" a new publication by artist [Liz Barr](https://liz-barr.com/) through [GenderFail Press](https://www.genderfail.space/). Barr will be joined by writers Meg Pendoley and Blanche Brown in a series of readings for the event.

"Conditioner" considers women's sense of alienation from their bodies, caused by gender norms and beauty ideals, and the ways that the wellness and skincare industries either alleviate or exacerbate that alienation. Conditioner explores the nuances of the subject, accounting for the history of American cosmetics and skincare, as well as the ways that preceding feminist movements have addressed them. This is Barr's second publication with GenderFail.

**[Liz Barr](https://liz-barr.com/)** is an interdisciplinary artist based in West Philadelphia. She makes work about bodies and how we build them. Her zines can be found in libraries and bookstores in Philadelphia and elsewhere, including at Printed Matter, Inc.; Artbook at MoMA PS1; Quimby's; and Ulises. 

**Meg Pendoley** is a writer living in Philadelphia. She's interested in queer homes (bodies, houses, neighborhoods), the boundaries they share, and how what happens there might be recorded and kept. Her work appears in Apiary, Cleaver, and Tin House's Open Bar.

**Blanche Brown** is a poet from north Florida. She is finishing up temple's MFA program and owns two oyster knives.

**[GenderFail](https://www.genderfail.space/)** is a publishing and programming initiative that seeks to encourage projects that foster an intersectional queer subjectivity. GenderFail embraces failure as a site of cultural production. GenderFail has been apart of exhibitions, programs and events at MoMA PS1 (Long Island City), The International Center of Photography (NYC), Wendy's Subway (Brooklyn), Studio Museum (Harlem), William College Museum of Art (Williamstown), Vox Populi (Philadelphia), EFA Project Space (NYC) and many others.
