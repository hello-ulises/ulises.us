Join Ulises for the US release of [Taxis, Issue 64](http://brownbook.tv/magazine) of Brownbook magazine. For this issue, Brownbook takes a road trip with five taxi drivers from across the Middle East and North Africa, joining Ismail Khaouli, one of Morocco's last grand taxi drivers, along the roads that wind through the Atlas Mountains and stopping along Muscat's coastline with Mohamed Al Nuumani, the Omani student who taxis passengers around on the side. [RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/1373458529439350/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A5%2C%22page_id_source%22%3A1129359703814263%2C%22action_history%22%3A[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22main_list%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A1129359703814263%2C%5C%22tour_id%5C%22%3Anull%7D%22%7D]%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D)

The issue release party will feature screenings of Brownbook's short video features and interviews, as well as refreshments and an opportunity to browse and purchase a selection of themed back issues. 

Launched over 10 years ago, Brownbook is the essential guide to the contemporary Middle East and North Africa focusing on architecture, travel and other culture. The bimonthly magazine is dedicated to documenting the lesser known stories of the region – from the music of Kuwaiti pearl divers to the Iranian diaspora of Los Angeles.
