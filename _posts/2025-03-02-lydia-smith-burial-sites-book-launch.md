Join artist Lydia Smith for the launch of the multivolume artist book *Burial Sites*. Smith will share a reading paired with images selected from the project. A unique large-scale version of the book created for public exhibition will be displayed during the event for attendees to experience. *Burial Sites* was recently acquired by the Free Library of Philadelphia Maps Collection and features images of multiple Philadelphia cemeteries.

*Burial Site*s is an artist book and social practice project considering how burial landscapes reflect cultural rituals around death, mourning processes, and community politics. A project of accumulation, the book grapples with the task of documentation and the archive through images of monuments for the dead. *Burial Sites* comprises 13,000 images, spans 15 countries across six continents, and features over 250 cemeteries, memorials, crematoriums, and graveyards.
