On Friday, May 3, from 6 to 9 pm, Ulises will reopen in its new home at 1525 N American St., at Ray Philly. Join us for the [opening celebration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ulises-x-studio-105-opening-celebration-tickets-872557160957?aff=oddtdtcreator) and then again for a program with Kameelah Janan Rasheed, “[Come Play,](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/come-play-an-artist-led-program-by-kameelah-janan-rasheed-tickets-880473127827?aff=oddtdtcreator)” on Saturday, May 4, 5-7 PM. In this hybrid lecture-workshop-playtime event, Rasheed will offer autobiographical notes to contextualize the lineages of play that influence her practice.

The new location will integrate exhibitions, programming, and publications, presenting new offerings and incubating long-term initiatives that will open up opportunities for artists and publishing communities at a larger scale—a space gathered for publishing, ideas, and connection.

Inaugurating Ulises’s new location and kicking off our artists’ multiples series, “Commodities” in Studio 105, is a project by artist Kameelah Janan Rasheed, “— the soft technology of your poems split — s My body into 18: secreting,100 Stanzas ——— That Bow TOWARD no moons.” A self-described “learner,” Rasheed grapples with the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black knowledge production, information technologies, and modes of \[un]learning. Rasheed’s exhibition, on view May 3 - August 25, 2024, will focus on the erotics of play during the reading, writing, and publishing processes.
