Support Workshop: 1:30-4:00pm at the ICA

Risograph Workshop: 4:30-6:00pm at the ICA

[Please RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/1591081160970349/)

How can we support ourselves and each other? This workshop looks at the ways in which we meet our needs for wellbeing in order to dream, practice, and work on any project. Support extends beyond the life of our projects, often shaping the ways in which we navigate the contradictions of living and working on independent projects. Join us for an attunement, discussion, and mutual connection from 1:30-4:00pm and for a Risograph workshop feature an excerpt from our forthcoming book from 4:30-6:00pm. 

This workshop will be led by [BFAMFAPhD](http://bfamfaphd.com) collective members [Susan Jahoda](http://www.susanjahoda.com/), [Emilio Martinez Poppe](http://www.emilio.click/), and [Caroline Woolard](http://carolinewoolard.com/). The workshop comes from the collective BFAMFAPhD's pedagogical project, "Ways of Being." We invite people from all backgrounds and identities to participate in our programming. This is a LGBTQIA friendly space.

"Ways of Being" is a multi-platform pedagogical project which offers practices of collaboration, contemplation, and social-ecological analysis to postsecondary visual artists, arts students, and arts educators. Ways of Being is for educators who wish to connect art to economy; for students who make artworks that reflect the conditions of their own production. Ways of Being is a book, a deck of cards, and a cutting-edge, interactive educational website. The interactive website with videos games will be finished by September 2018 and the book be in print by January of 2019. The publisher is Punctum Books.

[BFAMFAPhD](/) is a collective of artists, designers, technologists, organizers, and educators who work in the intersection of art, technology, and political economy. Concerned about the impact of debt, rent, and precarity on the lives of creative people, BFAMFAPhD asks: What is a work of art in the age of $120,000 art degrees? Susan Jahoda is a Professor in Studio Arts at the University of Amherst, MA; Emilio Martinez Poppe is the Program Manager at Fourth Arts Block (FABnyc), New York, NY; Caroline Woolard is an Assistant Professor of Sculpture at The University of Hartford, CT. Core members not represented in this CV include Vicky Virgin, a Research Associate at The Center for Economic Opportunity, New York, NY and Agnes Szanyi, a lecturer and PhD candidate in Sociology at The New School, New York, NY.
