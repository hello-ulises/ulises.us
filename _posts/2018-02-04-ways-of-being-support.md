How can we support ourselves and each other? This workshop looks at the ways in which we meet our needs for wellbeing in order to dream, practice, and work on any project. Support extends beyond the life of our projects, often shaping the ways in which we navigate the contradictions of living and working on independent projects. Join us for an attunement, discussion, and mutual connection from 1:30-4:00pm and for a Risograph workshop feature an excerpt from our forthcoming book from 4:30-6:00pm. 

This workshop will be led by [BFAMFAPhD](http://bfamfaphd.com) collective members [Susan Jahoda](http://www.susanjahoda.com/), [Emilio Martinez Poppe](http://www.emilio.click/), and [Caroline Woolard](http://carolinewoolard.com/). The workshop comes from the collective BFAMFAPhD's pedagogical project, "Ways of Being." We invite people from all backgrounds and identities to participate in our programming. This is a LGBTQIA friendly space. This workshop comes at the invitation of Kayla Romberger and Nerissa Cooney of Ulises, and Sharon Hayes’ and Karen Redrobe’s course "Art and Resistance."

"Ways of Being" is a multi-platform pedagogical project which offers practices of collaboration, contemplation, and social-ecological analysis to postsecondary visual artists, arts students, and arts educators. Ways of Being is for educators who wish to connect art to economy; for students who make artworks that reflect the conditions of their own production. Ways of Being is a book, a deck of cards, and a cutting-edge, interactive educational website. The interactive website with videos games will be finished by September 2018 and the book be in print by January of 2019. The publisher is Punctum Books.
