Please join us for the opening reception of *Candice Lin: Interspecies Imbibements*, Saturday, December 14, 2024 from 6 – 9 PM. [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1105089515489?aff=oddtdtcreator)

*Candice Lin: Interspecies Imbibements* will be on view December 14, 2024 – March 16, 2025. Lin’s interest in interspecies relations comes from a place of intimacy that complicates our understanding of kinship, sexuality, and care. Her practice is deeply engaged with the entangled histories and iconographies of humans and non-humans within the context of imperialism. She asks questions about how we live with difference and how we wield or submit to power within relations of difference through examining attitudes of camaraderie, empathy, codependence, paternalism, and domination. \
\
Central to the exhibition is *Broth Soda*, a new canned drink multiple, blending seltzer and fish sauce, created to entice Roger the cat to have a drink with her, playfully questioning human-animal companionship and anthropomorphism. Other works reimagine domestic spaces as shared domains, highlighting the flux of control and consumption.\
\
PETS WELCOME! *Broth Soda* is available to all, but custom *Broth Soda* cocktails for human consumption. Find out what the briney buzz is all about.\

This exhibition concludes the *Commodities* series, featuring artists Kameelah Janan Rasheed and Ken Lum at Studio 105 at Ray Philly.
