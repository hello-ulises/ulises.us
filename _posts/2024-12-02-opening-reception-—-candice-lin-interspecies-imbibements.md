SAVE THE DATE for the opening reception of *Candice Lin: Interspecies Imbibements,* December 14, 6-9 PM. 

This exhibition explores the complexities of human-animal relationships, blending materials like pheromones, hormonal fog, and even a playful new creation, *Broth Soda*, for shared consumption. Through themes of intimacy, power, and care, Lin reimagines the boundaries of domesticity and companionship. 

Lin caps off the three-part “Commodities” series, following Kameelah Janan Rasheed and Ken Lum.
