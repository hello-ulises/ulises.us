Join artist Ken Lum for a table reading of *The Expulsion*, his feature-length script exploring the Chinese immigrant experience in post-slavery America. Assisted by actors, Lum’s performative reading will be followed by a discussion with Peter X Feng, Associate Professor of English at the University of Delaware and host of the Turner Classic Movies series *Race and Hollywood: Asian Images in Film* (2009).\
\
Set in Tacoma, Washington Territory, in 1885, *The Expulsion* depicts the challenges faced by Chinese laborers during a period marked by intense anti-Chinese sentiment. The script highlights the waterfront Chinatown ingeniously built on stilts beyond the city’s limits and the community’s struggles leading up to the expulsion date set by Tacoma’s mayor. This event will also celebrate the launch of Lum’s new monograph, published by Steidl.
