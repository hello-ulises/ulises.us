About the Escape Artist Mixtape: \
Multi-disciplinary artist Li Sumpter explores the ‘art of survival’ through the stories of everyday escape artists, and creative problem solvers responding to structural violence and climate crisis. In the spirit of the classic mixtape, episodes are curated in a mixed media collage including musical interludes, performative PSAs and recurring thematic segments designed to engage listening audiences live in real time and offline at their leisure.
