For December's Second Thursday, join Ulises for a deeper look at *New Neighbors*, an exhibition that pairs Ursinus College studio art faculty with area artists with whom they share an affinity. Together, these collaborations explore place, proximity, and the creative exchange that unfolds when artistic practices intersect. The accompanying catalog features four essays and installation photography that expand on each pairing.

Reception from 6–9 PM, with an informal artist talk at 7 PM

* **Ursinus College studio art faculty:** David Aipperspach, Cari Freno, Sarah Kaufman, and Sarah Pater
* **Paired artists:** Sarah McEneaney, Chad States, Tony Bragg, and Nadia Hironaka and Matthew Suib
* **Contributing catalog authors:** Jacob Feige, Kati Gegenheimer, Rebecca Robertson, Stan Mir
* **Catalog design:** Jeanne Komp
