Join the Ulises team in celebrating our 3 year anniversary and a big move! The books and furniture are already gone, so bring dancing shoes. There will be drinks and movin and groovin as we embrace change and remember so many great moments in the old garage-turned bookstore. Tunes to move to by DJ Mier Mier Mier Mier Mier (Jamier Bieber Snell) & jay plus.

We are saying goodbye to our 31 E Columbia Ave location but are going to be plenty busy with pop-ups and planning a new spot, to open early 2020.
