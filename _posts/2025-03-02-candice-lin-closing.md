Join Ulises for an afternoon of making and imbibing in celebration of the final days of Candice Lin’s *Commodities* exhibition, *Interspecies Imbibements*.\
\
From 2-4pm, our friends at The Clay Studio will host a ceramics workshop where participants will be asked to respond to works in the exhibition. Create a ceramic pillow, a mug for your favorite interspecies beverage, or a feed bowl for your favorite furry friend. 

Following the workshop, from 4-7pm join us for happy hour and enjoy custom cocktails featuring Candice Lin’s famous Broth Soda™, designed by the artist.
