*C﻿andice Lin:* I*nterspecies Imbibements* is on view December 14, 2024 – March 16, 2025. Lin’s interest in interspecies relations comes from a place of intimacy that complicates our understanding of kinship, sexuality, and care. Her practice is deeply engaged with the entangled histories and iconographies of humans and non-humans within the context of imperialism. She asks questions about how we live with difference and how we wield or submit to power within relations of difference through examining attitudes of camaraderie, empathy, codependence, paternalism, and domination. 

In this exhibition, Lin considers porosity as an exchange with others and our larger environment through the convivial act of imbibement. She developed Broth Soda, a new, canned drink that combines seltzer water with fish sauce to produce a fizzy, savory concoction intended to entice Roger the cat to have a drink with her. With the creation of this artist’s multiple, Lin examines the social construct of the pet in terms of human-animal companionship by playing with the limits and narrative structures of anthropomorphism as a methodology. Other works on view subvert the domicile as a built environment to consider home as another domain shared by humans and animals in which consumption and control are in flux. By drawing parallels between materials, such as clay and carpeting, and their functionality, Lin brings attention to the shared aesthetics of feline domestication and human domesticity to engender cohabitation and explore how compromising situations can otherwise be enjoyed. 

Lin’s exhibition is the final installment of the three-part artists’ multiples series, *Commodities*, which featured artists Kameelah Janan Rasheed and Ken Lum at Studio 105.
