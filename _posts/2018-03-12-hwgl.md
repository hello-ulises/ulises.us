[Hardworking Goodlooking (HWGL)](http://officeocd.com/) was established in 2013 by The Office of Culture and Design (The OCD) as a publishing imprint and graphic design studio interested in decolonization of aesthetic voices, vernacular artisanry, and giving value to the invisible. Founded by Clara Lobregat Balaguer and Kristian Henson in 2010, the OCD is a research and project production platform out of Parañaque City and Brooklyn, for social practice in art and design.
