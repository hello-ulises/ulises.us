[Hardworking Goodlooking (HWGL)](http://officeocd.com/) was established in 2013 by The Office of Culture and Design (The OCD) as a publishing imprint and graphic design studio interested in decolonization of aesthetic voices, vernacular artisanry, and giving value to the invisible. Founded by Clara Lobregat Balaguer and Kristian Henson in 2010, the OCD is a research and project production platform out of Parañaque City and Brooklyn, for social practice in art and design.

Hardworking Goodlooking's three-week residency will be an exercise in running a “mosquito press,” referring to the illegal presses of the Martial Law era (1972-1986) that were critical of the conjugal dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. As freedom of the press is currently threatened under the regime of neoauthoritarian president Rodrigo Duterte, HWGL will organize a series of intimate talks (and potluck meals) to discuss the Philippines’ current political situation with Filipino academics. The content generated in these discussions—plus content mined from long-running research into ideological internet trolls—will be printed as an homage to the mosquito press format: compiled as the documentation/ephemera of collective radical action, quickly and precariously printed, critical of a dictatorial regime, distributed via informal networks, often at personal risk.
