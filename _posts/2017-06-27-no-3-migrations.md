title: No. 3 Migrations
categories: right
---

"Migrations” considers how artists, thinkers, and whole communities engage narratives of movement and traversal, sanctuary and refuge. Through video, photography, and readings from artists Marwa Arsanios, Tania Bruguera, Banu Cennetoğlu, and Xaviera Simmons, Ulises will explore the poetics of migration and trouble our notions of origin and boundaries. Further contributions of workshops, screenings, lectures, and presentations will survey and remap these themes throughout the course of the season.

No. 3 "Migrations" Quarter: July 1 – September 30, 2017
