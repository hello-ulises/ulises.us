"Migrations” considers how artists, thinkers, and whole communities engage narratives of movement and traversal, sanctuary and refuge. Through video, photography, and readings from artists [Marwa Arsanios](http://www.mor-charpentier.com/artist/marwa-arsonios/), [Tania Bruguera](http://www.taniabruguera.com/cms/), [Banu Cennetoğlu](http://rodeo-gallery.com/artists/banu-cennetoglu/), and [Xaviera Simmons](https://davidcastillogallery.com/artist/xaviera-simmons/), Ulises will explore the poetics of migration and trouble our notions of origin and boundaries. Further contributions of workshops, screenings, lectures, and presentations will survey and remap these themes throughout the course of the season.

“The List” is a document that contains the information of known refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants who have died within, or on the borders of Europe since 1993. The data is compiled and updated each year by UNITED for Intercultural Action. Since 2006, in collaboration with art workers and institutions, Banu Cennetoğlu maintains up-to-date and translated versions of “The List” for public display and dissemination.
