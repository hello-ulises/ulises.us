For 2025, organizations were asked to respond to a series of prompts relating to the year’s guiding question: What knowledges can we unearth to reorganize how we think, work, and be in this world?

This grant provides $150,000 in funding over three years, supporting our ability to plan long-term, sustain experimental and critically engaged work, and continue investing in the people and ideas that shape our programs.

Based in Milwaukee and national in scope, Ruth Arts honors benefactor Ruth DeYoung Kohler II (1941–2020) with inventive approaches to philanthropy that are rooted in creativity, experimentation, and access.
