Ulises presents Publishing As Practice, a three-part publisher residency designed to explore publishing as an incubator for new forms of editorial, curatorial, and artistic practice. Three experimental art publishers will activate Ulises as an exhibition space and public programming hub, engaging the public through workshops, discussions, and projects. 

Residents include Hardworking Goodlooking, the publishing arm of Philippines-based, social practice platform The Office of Culture and Design; Dominica, an imprint run by Martine Syms dedicated to exploring blackness as a topic, reference, marker and audience in visual culture; and Bidoun, a non-profit organization focused on art and culture from the Middle East and its diasporas. These practitioners reveal that publishing is an activity in constant flux, one that continues to evolve and grow in the era of drag and drop, copy and paste. The project will culminate in a publication featuring the work of all three residents.
