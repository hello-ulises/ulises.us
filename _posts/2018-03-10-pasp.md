Ulises presents Publishing As Practice, a three-part publisher residency designed to explore publishing as an incubator for new forms of editorial, curatorial, and artistic practice. Three experimental art publishers will activate the storefront space of Ulises as an exhibition space and public programming hub, engaging the public through workshops, discussions, and projects. Residents include: Hardworking Goodlooking (Clara Balaguer and Kristian Henson) the publishing arm of Philippines-based, social practice platform The Office of Culture and Design; Dominica (Martine Syms) an imprint dedicated to exploring blackness as a topic, reference, marker and audience in visual culture, and Bidoun, a non-profit organization focused on art and culture from the Middle East and its diasporas.
