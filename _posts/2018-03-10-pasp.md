Ulises presents Publishing As Practice, a three-part publisher residency designed to explore publishing as an incubator for new forms of editorial, curatorial, and artistic practice. Three experimental art publishers will activate Ulises as an exhibition space and public programming hub, engaging the public through workshops, discussions, and projects.
