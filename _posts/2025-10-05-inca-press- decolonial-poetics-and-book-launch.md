Sunday, October 12, 2:00 - 4:00 PM, [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decolonial-poetics-and-book-launch-w-inca-press-tickets-1751985990259?aff=oddtdtcreator)

Join Ulises for a book launch and presentation with [INCA Press](https://incapress.org/) founders Aeron Bergman and Alejandra Salinas along with an introduction by INCA Press board member and collaborator Laurel V. McLaughlin.

The event will center on a presentation of the press's most recent title, *KIRKI QHAÑI – Container of Andean Poetics* by Elvira Espejo Ayca. This collection of essays and poems/songs situates Aymara ancestrality and Andean poetics within a contemporary discourse. The book serves as both a beautiful archive of Andean traditions and a powerful call to address urgent futures. \

Bergman and Salinas will also discuss INCA Press’s broader publishing practice, highlighting key titles and themes across their catalog, from the status of art under neoliberalism and decolonization at Bolivia’s National Museum of Art, to explorations of early capitalist expropriation of common lands.

INCA Press publishes experimental and contemporary art books—encompassing books as art, books on art, artists’ writings, and interdisciplinary inventions. They support work that exists between the academy, art, poetry, sociology, and activism.
