Join Ulises and The Berman Museum of Art for the launch of the “Enrique Bostelmann: Apertures and Borderscapes” exhibition catalog, on view through December 15. This bilingual catalog delves into the depth and breadth of Bostelmann’s career, exploring the political borders of the American continent and the aesthetic boundaries of photography.

The evening will feature a screening of “Making Apertures and Borderscapes” (2024), a documentary produced by the Berman Museum. Following the screening, filmmaker Bernardo Morillo and curator Deborah Barkun will join us for a discussion about the film, the exhibition, and the catalog.
