Please join Ulises this Saturday for the Philadelphia launch of the newest issue of The Third Rail. The launch will feature a short screening program of videos connected to Issue 10 and Ulises' quarterly theme, Intimacy. Jonathan Thomas, editor of The Third Rail, will give a brief introduction. Drinks and light refreshments will be available.

At 8pm we will screen a teaser from Adam Khalil and Zack Khalil's second feature film, "Empty Metal," co-directed with Barry James Sweitzer, followed by Mati Diop and Manon Lutanie's "Liberian Boy" (2015), and two shorts by Alexander Kluge: "BLIND LOVE / Jean-Luc Godard: My mother had only seen silent films!," and "TSCHAK TSCHAK BOING / Love in a Space Suit" (both 2001). 

[Issue 10](http://thirdrailquarterly.org/) of The Third Rail features an in-depth interview with writer, filmmaker, and television pioneer Alexander Kluge by Jonathan Thomas, in which Kluge shares his theory of montage and constellational filmmaking, discusses his move from cinema into television, and unpacks his principle of the city; psychoanalyst Jamieson Webster recalls her first dreams on the analytic couch; actress and filmmaker Mati Diop and independent publisher Manon Lutanie present a four-minute dance film; film critics Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin reflect on Isabelle Huppert’s performance style, both in print and with an audiovisual essay online; filmmaker Sky Hopinka discusses indigenous poetics, language revitalization, and experimental modes of documentary filmmaking with filmmakers Adam Khalil and Zack Khalil, and shares a video online; poet Anne Boyer writes on a rebellion against images; experimental flutist and composer Barbara Held is interviewed by Alexandra Alisauskas and Godfre Leung and discusses breath as a medium, composer-interpreter-audience relations, and her approach to the indeterminate scores of Alvin Lucier and Yasunao Tone; chef Michelle Gayer offers a tool for fighting fascism; and there are artist projects by John Fleischer and Sara Greenberger Rafferty.
