Please join us for a very special presentation entitled "After Ulises (Carrión): Artists' Books and DIY Publishing in & Around The Netherlands." [RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/442920809507833/)

As a project space for bookworks, Ulises Carrión's "Other Books and So" (Amsterdam, 1975-79) was an experiment across contemporary art, poetry and experimental archiving. It continued a history that began with Fluxus in the 1960s and became the blueprint for a number of artists' books and DIY publishing spaces, initiatives and projects in and around the Netherlands, from the 1980s until today. In his informal talk, Florian Cramer will reconstruct this history - and its contemporary overlaps with zine culture and media activism, - show excerpts of Ulises Carrión's video works and, with a bit of luck, phone in a former collaborator of Carrión in the Netherlands.

[Florian Cramer](https://www.phdarts.eu/Supervisors/FlorianCramer) is a reader at Willem de Kooning Academy, Rotterdam, Netherlands, where he also volunteers for the DIY publishing and experimental arts venues & projects PrintRoom, De Player and ZineCamp. He wrote the afterword for Alessandro Ludovico's "Post-Digital Print" and co-authored the zine "The Moral of the Xerox: Missalette" with former Ulises resident Clara Balaguer.
