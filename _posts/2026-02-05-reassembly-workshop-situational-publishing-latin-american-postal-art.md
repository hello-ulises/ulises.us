In this lecture and workshop, librarian and arts organizer Sal Hamerman connects Can Can Press' Reassembly “Situational Publishing” project to the broader histories of mail art as a networked and cross-cultural practice that is simultaneously playful and political. Ulises Carrión's work asks us to consider how postal art connects relational strategies such as listening, sampling and sequencing to the "Big Monster" of state bureaucracy. In the 1970s and 1980s, Carrión served as a key point of contact with Latin American mail artists such as Edgardo Antonio Vigo, Clemente Padín, Graciela Gutiérrez Marx, and Paulo Bruscky, who were living under authoritarian political conditions. These artists' work playfully subverted and made visible the conditions of censorship and violence that they were experiencing, using the mail to forge international solidarities. 



The short talk will be followed by an opportunity to create mail art in response to Can Can's project.
