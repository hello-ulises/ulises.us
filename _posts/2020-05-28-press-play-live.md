Looking forward to participating in FORTUNE's online panel with other QT/POC-run small presses and print spaces, including No Shame Distro, Sponge Gourd Collective, Endless Editions, and Other Publishing to discuss print resources and futures. 

As we come together toward an uncertain future, we hope to ground ourselves in print as an act of resource-sharing, of radical gathering, of material resilience — something to hold on to. Join us as we connect with print collectives to share experiences and best practices for inspired, sustainable, accessible, and community-oriented work. 

What are the strategies, sources of support, and print forebears on which we can lean? How do we continue to document this coming-together? 

This program is part of FORTUNE’s archival practice during the Year of the Rat. Project support provided by The Velocity Fund administered by Temple Contemporary at Tyler School of Art and Architecture, Temple University with generous funding from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.
