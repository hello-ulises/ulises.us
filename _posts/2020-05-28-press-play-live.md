Looking forward to participating in a panel, organized by Many Fortunes, with other QT/POC-run small presses and print spaces to discuss print resources and futures. 

As we come together toward an uncertain future, we hope to ground ourselves in print as an act of resource-sharing, of radical gathering, of material resilience — something to hold on to. Join us as we connect with print collectives to share experiences and best practices for inspired, sustainable, accessible, and community-oriented work. 

What are the strategies, sources of support, and print forebears on which we can lean? How do we continue to document this coming-together? 

Let’s talk about it: PRESS PLAY on SUNDAY, MAY 31st 2–4 PM via Zoom (registration link in bio — details will be sent after registration) for conversation with: No Shame Distro, Sponge Gourd Collective, Endless Editions, Other Publishing, and Ulises.


This program is part of FORTUNE’s archival practice during the Year of the Rat. Project support provided by The Velocity Fund administered by Temple Contemporary at Tyler School of Art and Architecture, Temple University with generous funding from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.
