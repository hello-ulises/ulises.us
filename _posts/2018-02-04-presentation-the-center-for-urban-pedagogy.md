Frampton Tolbert, Deputy Director of the [Center for Urban Pedagogy](http://welcometocup.org/) will present a talk on Design and Civic Engagement at Ulises. The talk will focus on the history of CUP, its mission and recent projects, along with ongoing initiatives. 

The Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP) is a nonprofit organization that uses the power of design and art to increase meaningful civic engagement. CUP collaborates with designers, educators, advocates, students, and communities to make educational tools that demystify complex policy and planning issues.
