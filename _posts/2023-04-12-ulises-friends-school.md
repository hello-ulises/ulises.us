April 19-21, Ulises will be in Utrecht leading Ulises Friends School, a series of workshops that invite participants to investigate the generative potential of friendship. In simplest terms, Ulises is a bookshop and project space dedicated to artists' books and independent art publications. In the truest terms, Ulises is a collection of musings, longings, and assorted activities brought together by a group of friends. This is to say that friendship is the medium, ethos, and structure of Ulises.  \
\
Ulises Friends School is a part of [Ultradependent Public School (UPS)](https://www.bakonline.org/program-item/full-program-ultradependent-public-schoool/) transforming BAK, basis voor actuele kunst, into a schoolhouse and a curriculum to learn what we really need to enact the worlds we really want.  Emphasizing study as a radically collective, public labor that lives in-between institutionalized hierarchies, UPS inhabits the edges between formal classrooms and everyday life.\
\
All participants will have the opportunity to be included in a cumulative publication, a “Yearbook\[let]” made over the three workshop periods.\
\
Day 1: “With Friends Like These…”\
Day 2: “Truth be Told / You Didn’t Hear it From Me…”\
Day 3: “Let’s Stay in Touch”
