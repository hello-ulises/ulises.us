Initiated in 2005, Printed Matter’s NY Art Book Fair (NYABF) is the leading international gathering for the distribution of artists’ books, celebrating the full breadth of the art publishing community.

Held at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, the 2019 NY Art Book Fair will host 369 exhibitors from 31 countries, including a broad range of artists and collectives, small presses, institutions, galleries, antiquarian booksellers, and distributors. Free and open to the public, the event draws more than 40,000 individuals including book lovers, collectors, artists, and art world professionals each year. With a commitment to diversity and representation, the fair will serve as a meeting place for an extended community of publishers and book enthusiasts, as well as a site for dialogue and exchange around all facets of arts publishing.
