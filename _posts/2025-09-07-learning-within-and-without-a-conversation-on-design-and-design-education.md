Join Ulises on Friday, September 19, from 6 to 8 pm for a conversation between independent publishers/design studios Further Reading (Bandung, Indonesia) and Other Means (Brooklyn, NY). This conversation, part celebration, part launch of the recent publication [Further Reading Print No.4: Learning Within, Learning Without](https://www.ideabooks.nl/further-reading-print-no-4-learning-within-learning-without), will focus on the themes of the book, spotlighting “self-organised, spontaneous, sporadic, and informal educational initiatives within the realm of creative practices, both historical and contemporary."

[Further Reading](http://further-reading.club/) is an independent multi-format publishing platform with a production and distribution unit. We seek to engage in discourse within design practices by exploring the wider contexts through various programmed experiences, such as online publications, printed periodicals, pop-ups, and workshops.

[Other Means](https://othermeans.us/) is a graphic design studio in Brooklyn, NY.Other Means works with institutions, organizations, and brands who present, support, and contribute to contemporary culture. We design dynamic typographic identities and brand strategies that thrive in digital environments, and make books, exhibitions, signage systems, and websites that emerge from a deep engagement with our clients’ missions and histories.
