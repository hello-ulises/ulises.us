Her curatorial projects focus on artistic exploration of struggles and hardships that are often overlooked, such as those of ethnic and gender minorities, women, and immigrant workers. She previously worked at numerous museums and galleries both in Korea and the United States, including the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea, Hyundai Card, Kukje Gallery, as well as for the Gwangju Biennale and Performa, New York. Chung holds an MA in the Humanities from the University of Chicago and a BA in Art History from Wesleyan University.
