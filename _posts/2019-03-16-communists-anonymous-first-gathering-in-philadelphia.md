Join the first gathering of Communists Anonymous in Philadelphia, a celebration of the constitutive book "Solution 275–294: Communists Anonymous" (edited by Ingo Niermann and Joshua Simon, Sternberg Press, 2017), with Hammam Aldouri, Mark Johnson, Pavel Khazanov, Kate Kraczon, Marina McDougall Vella, Joshua Simon, Helen Stuhr-Rommereim, and everyone interested in sharing their relations to communisms present, past, and future.

The members of Communists Anonymous (COMA) suffer from an incurable belief in communism. They don’t share any particular school, but they do share an extreme sense of empathy and justice, and therefore detest more or less any form of private property. Because there is currently no communist state in existence, acting out their passion would hopelessly distress them, at best curbing and stabilizing the brutalities of capitalist society.

COMA is meant to evolve into a worldwide cluster of self-help groups where incurable communists can discuss their recent temptations and relapses in the futile fight against capitalism. COMA’s “fearless moral inventory” challenges the historical manifestations of communism as being substantially incomplete in thought and practice and places communism again where it originates—in the realm of fiction. COMA believes that the most vital dialectics in human history are at play in fiction contradicting reality. Only as fiction can communism manifest itself again beyond doubt.
