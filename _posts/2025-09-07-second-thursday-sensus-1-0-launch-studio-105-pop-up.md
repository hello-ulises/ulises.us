Join Ulises in partnership with Studio 105 for the launch of SENSUS Issue 1.0, a new Philadelphia-based arts publication, in conjunction with “streetview”, a group exhibition featuring the work of Amanda Crain-Freeland, Arnab Gan Choudhury, Ari Zauro, Heather Swenson, Maddie Rodriguez, and Logan Crompton, curated by Macy West and Diego Juarez.

SENSUS is a quarterly independent arts publication dedicated to celebrating contemporary arts and supporting the Philadelphia community of makers. As an artists for artists project, SENSUS seeks to showcase emerging artists, generate critical dialogue, and connect artists with each other and to their audiences. The project curates social and political commentary centered around contemporary visual arts including interviews, critical essays, and show reviews. 

Existing primarily in print, SENSUS prioritizes the tactile over the ubiquitous and consumable stream of digital media. It chooses engagement with the physical world and material experience, connecting back to the function of the art object as something of aesthetic value existing in discrete units. 

I**ssue 1.0 includes** — Writing from: Aradhna Johnson, Ash Nichols, Mika Obayashi, Ivy Jewell, Laura Sallade, Meredith Sellers, Lane Timothy Speidel, Srđan Tunić, and Ari Zuaro in the form of poetry, critical essays, show reviews and more. Featured Artists: Gerald Brown, Arnab Gan Choudhury, Amanda Crain-Freeland, Logan Crompton, Jacob Feige, Isabelle Gotuaco, Olivia Jia, Zach Ozma, Kaitlin Pomerantz, Maddie Jones Rodriguez, Libby Rosa, Gianna Santucci, Heather Swenson and Kristen Neville Taylor.

**“streetview”** — The daily commute to work. Work and home again on repeat. What happens when our desire paths are no longer built from desire but obligation? By optimizing our commutes in the name of efficiency, we’ve eliminated the potential for adventure and discovery. The work in streetview recenters curiosity as a tool for navigating the complexity of urban space. To do so challenges every capitalist impulse droned into us from birth. The six artists featured in the show observe and emphasize various aspects of urban life including childhood memories blurred by time, the violence camouflaged by the gloss of advertising, ad hoc architectures and bar fights that spill out onto the streets.  

These insights come from a direct engagement with the urban environment as a pedestrian moving through the city on foot. This kind of engagement prioritizes people, local communities, your neighborhood bar, and open lots over skyscrapers and millennial grey vinyl siding. Through disparate aesthetics, these artists form a fractured narrative of urban life as a site for negotiating conflicting desires. At its best, a city is a place where wildly disparate people coexist with each other despite their differences and in that way, it is idyllic. Despite the challenges of living in an increasingly gentrified and defunded landscape, we choose it. In the worldview of these artists, urban space is less of a reflection of our biases and differences and more of a site of connection and egalitarian politics.
