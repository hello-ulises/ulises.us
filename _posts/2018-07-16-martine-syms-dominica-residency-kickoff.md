Residency Kickoff, July 22, 2–6PM
Readings by [Diamond Stingily](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/gyw7nb/the-world-needs-more-artists-like-diamond-stingily) and [Rami George](http://ramigeorge.net/)

Publishing as Practice: Martine Syms/Dominica is the second installment of a three-part publishing residency, designed to explore publishing as an incubator for new forms of editorial, curatorial, and artistic practice. On July 22 we'll celebrate the kickoff of Dominica's residency with several readings from Dominica-published artists and friends along with drinks and snacks and summer vibes.

Martine Syms will operate through Dominica, the publishing imprint founded by the artist in 2011 dedicated to exploring blackness as a reference, marker, and topic. For the duration of the residency, Martine will transform the Ulises space into a shop selling new screen printed apparel and feature select texts, visual materials, and programming produced by the artist and collaborators. Syms will refashion the Dominica and Ulises websites into in a digital storefront and live streaming platform in the style of an online Home Shopping Network. Publishing as Practice: Martine Syms considers the shop as a central aspect of independent publishing—not only a site of a commercial transaction but also a locus of social exchange.

Support for Publishing As Practice has been provided to Kayla Romberger by The Pew Center for Arts & Heritage.
