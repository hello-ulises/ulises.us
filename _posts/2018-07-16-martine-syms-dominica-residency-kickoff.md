Publishing as Practice is a three-part publishing residency, designed to explore publishing as an incubator for new forms of editorial, curatorial, and artistic practice.

For the second installment of Publishing as Practice: Dominica—the publishing imprint founded by Martine Syms in 2011 dedicated to exploring blackness as a reference, marker, and topic—will transform the Ulises space into a shop selling new screen printed apparel and feature select texts, visual materials, and programming produced by the artist and collaborators. Syms will refashion the Dominica and Ulises websites into in a digital storefront and live streaming platform in the style of an online Home Shopping Network. Publishing as Practice: Martine Syms considers the shop as a central aspect of independent publishing—not only a site of a commercial transaction but also a locus of social exchange.

Support for Publishing As Practice has been provided to Kayla Romberger by The Pew Center for Arts & Heritage.
