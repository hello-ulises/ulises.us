What happens when a transgender boxer and their wife attempt to adopt a Korean child from the internet? 

Students from Penn State Abington’s LGBTQ Identity, Culture, and the Arts: Queer Kinship course present a staged reading of *Wolf Play* (2019) by Hansol Jung, directed by Jack Isaac Pryor. Based on a true story, this magical and timely play explores queer kinship, transnational adoption, and the power of make-believe.
