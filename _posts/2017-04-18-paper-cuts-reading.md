[Paper Cuts](http://clocktower.org/series/paper-cuts) continues its celebration of zines and DIY publishing with a reading at Ulises. Join us as we host an evening of reading, conversation, and liberal libations.

Readers:
- Arno Mokros
- J Pascoe
- Alex Smith

Following the readings there will be a brief discussion moderated by Paper Cuts host, Christopher Kardambikis. A recording of the readings will later be available on the Clocktower Radio archive.
