***Book Launch: Ulises Carrión: Bookworks and Beyond***\
Saturday, May 11, 1–3pm\
[RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ulises-carrion-bookworks-and-beyond-book-launch-tickets-884359271387?aff=oddtdtcreator)

Join Ulises to celebrate the launch of the publication “Ulises Carrión: Bookworks and Beyond,” issued in conjunction with an exhibition of the same title, on view at Princeton University Library’s Milberg Gallery curated by Sal Hamerman and Javier Rivero Ramos.

The publication is a richly illustrated account of the life and work of  Carrión, a twentieth-century Mexican artist, and writer who reimagined what the book could look like, mean, and do; the event features a conversation between artist and curator Sal Hamerman, curator Camilo Otero, and Ulises co-founders, reflecting on Carrión’s legacy and resonance across the contemporary field of artists’ publishing. The conversation will be followed by an informal activity to create and send mail art, featuring artists’ stamps and postcards inspired by Carrión’s own contributions to the transnational mail art networks of the 1970s and 1980s. 

Sal Hamerman (they/them) co-curated the Carrión exhibition and is a Metadata Librarian specializing in rare books at Princeton University Library. Camilo Otero (he/him) is the Artist Programs Manager at the Center for Book Arts in New York City.
