Publishing as Practice: Hardworking Goodlooking, Martine Syms/Dominica, Bidoun is a publication documenting a residency at Ulises, a curatorial platform based in Philadelphia that explores publishing as an incubator for new forms of editorial, curatorial, and artistic practice.

Over the course of two years, three publishers activated Ulises as an exhibition space and public programming hub, engaging the public through workshops, discussions, and projects. Residents included Hardworking Goodlooking, the publishing arm of Philippines-based, social practice platform The Office of Culture and Design; Dominica, an imprint run by Martine Syms dedicated to exploring blackness as a topic, reference, marker, and audience in visual culture; and Bidoun, a non-profit organization focused on art and culture from the Middle East and its diasporas.

Edited by Kayla Romberger, Gee Wesley, Nerissa Cooney, Lauren Downing, and Ricky Yanas. Texts by Clara Balaguer, Hardworking Goodlooking, Martine Syms/Dominica, Bidoun, Lauren Downing, Kayla Romberger, Gee Wesley, and Ulises Carriôn. Preface by David Senior.
