Pharmacy Books is popping up at Ulises! Celebrate the opening on December 6th with bubbles by the glass and complimentary oysters from Bar Mish Mish. Explore yet-to-be-released projects and sold-out titles from the Brooklyn-based artist book publisher. 

[Pharmacy Books](https://pharmacy-books.com/) is an independent publisher of artists’ books, founded by designer Nick Massarelli in 2024. Based in Brooklyn with roots in Philadelphia, they create limited-edition books at the intersection of photography, design, and fine art. Although longtime friends and collaborators, this will be their first event at Ulises.\
\
Bar Mish Mish is a pop-up wine bar run by the team behind [Mish Mish](https://www.mishmishphilly.com/), the well-loved (and recently Michelin-recognized) East Passyunk restaurant. Their pop-up usually takes place at Ace Outpost in Queen Village on First Fridays, but we're lucky to have them trekking all the way up to South Kensington to celebrate with us. (You can also catch them on Friday night, 12/5, at Ace Outpost.)\
