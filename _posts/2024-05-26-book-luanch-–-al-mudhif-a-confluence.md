What happens when you build a traditional structure from the marshes of Iraq in the woods of Pennsylvania? This is the story of Al Mudhif - as told by the artists, Iraqi refugees, Iraq War veterans, and other community members who brought it to life in 2021, at the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education in Philadelphia. 

Mudhifs have been built in Southern Iraq for at least 5,000 years, and are made entirely out of Phragmites reed, which grows abundantly in both Iraq and Philadelphia. In Iraq, Phragmites is a valued building material and indigenous to the area. In the U.S., it is reviled as an invasive plant. Touching on themes of displacement, war, radical hospitality, healing, reconciliation, cultural preservation, and contemporary art, this book lovingly documents the journey from harvesting materials to its final dismantling, and the lessons we learned along the way. 

Edited by Yaroub Al Obaidi, Sarah Kavage, and L.A. Enck. Introduction by Michael Rakowitz, Daniel Tucker, and Tina Plokarz. Book design by Saif Sarah Designs
