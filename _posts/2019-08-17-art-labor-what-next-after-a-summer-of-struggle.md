This a very particular moment of change for the art and museum field. Agitating around issues of part-time contracts, workplace safety, lack of benefits, and equity across different vectors, recent months have witnessed a wave of unionizing, landmark labor discrimination lawsuits, public salary sharing, and work for equity of representation of critics and cultural voices, amongst other highly visible and completely invisible work. 

What comes next after this summer of struggle? Join the conversation, moderated by Michelle Fisher, on behalf of [Art + Museum Transparency](https://twitter.com/amtransparency?lang=en). She'll be joined by New Museum's Dana Kopel, Drew Ambrogi of Coworker.org, independent curator Chaédria LaBouvier, and Sara Ziff founder of Model Alliance. 

[RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/866554137061433/), Free to attend! 
If you can, help us out by bringing a snack, or drink, or chair.

Current and former employees of art institutions started sharing the terms and salaries of their employment in a public Google Spreadsheet titled “Art/Museum Salary Transparency 2019," started by Michelle. You can [view the spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_cn3afoas7NhKvHWaFKqQGkaZS5rvL6DFxzGqXQa6o/edit#gid=0) and add your information through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYV_efuUiEG8BnuD1_XwLaY7bEjsBgYxeWs3nFcP4sAQAC_w/viewform).
