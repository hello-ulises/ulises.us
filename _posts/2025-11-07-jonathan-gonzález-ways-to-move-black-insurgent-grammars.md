Thursday, November 20, 7:00 – 9:00pm, [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1936216087439?aff=oddtdtcreator)

Ulises and Ugly Duckling Presse present a book launch for Jonathan González’s *Ways to Move: Black Insurgent Grammars.* Choreographer, artist, and writer Jonathan González hosts an evening of sonic and embodied performances by Kingsley Ibeneche and Vitch Boul-Ra, prompted by Ways to Move. The event will also feature a reading by González.\
\
Moving between archival fragments, rehearsal notes, and speculative memory, *Ways to Move: Black Insurgent Grammars* traces the embodied frequencies and assembled states of Black life. González theorizes Blackness as a grammar, occupying the interstices of white colonial culture; Black movement and expression are both defined by and break down the hegemonic. Through a consideration of land, politics, magic, and movement, this hybrid work performs the perpetually unfinished task of resistance.
