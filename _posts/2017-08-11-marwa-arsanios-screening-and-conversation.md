"Through recorded testimony, Who is afraid of ideology? Part I tracks the practical work of the Kurdish autonomous women’s movement—how to use an axe, how to eat fish within its biological cycles of production, when to cut down a tree for survival and when to save it. But the film also explores how individuals come to a conscious participation in the movement—in short, how they become part of the guerrilla." - Mason Leaver-Yap

In “Falling Is Not Collapsing, Falling Is Extending," Marwa Arsanios addresses the impact of the migration of waste on the changing landscape of Beirut, the city where she lives and works, which has been marked by the rapid development of its urban spaces and burdened by a recent garbage crisis.

Marwa Arsanios was born in Washington D.C. and lives and works in Beirut, Lebanon. She received her MFA from University of the Arts London in 2007 and was a researcher in the Fine Art department at Jan Van Eyck Academie from 2011 to 2012. She has had solo exhibitions at Witte de With, Rotterdam, the Netherlands (2016); The Hammer, Los Angeles (2016); Kunsthalle Lissabon, Lisbon (2015); and Art in General, New York (2015). Her work was also shown at the 55th Venice Biennale (2013); the 12th Istanbul Biennial (2011); Home Works Forum in Beirut (2010, 2013, 2015); the New Museum, New York (2014); M HKA, Antwerp, Belgium (2013); and nGbK, Berlin (2012). Screenings of her videos have taken place at the Berlinale, Berlin (2010, 2015), e-flux storefront, New York (2009), and Centre Pompidou, Paris (2011). In 2012, Arsanios was awarded the special prize of the Pinchuk Future Generation Art Prize.
