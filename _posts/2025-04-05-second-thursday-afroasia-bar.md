**[RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/second-thursday-afroasia-bar-tickets-1299975424489?aff=oddtdtcreator)**

“AfroAsia Bar: A Gamming” is a solidarity pop-up blending original cocktails, art, and political education—plus fundraising for humanitarian aid work. Bars have long served as spaces of refuge, especially for queer communities. Historically, a gamming was a social meeting between whalers at sea; it can also refer to a school of whales. To stay afloat, let’s gam!

Suggested entry: $15–$20 (pay what you can). All proceeds will support relief efforts in Gaza and Haiti.

Featured Drinks: Flor de Tahrir, The Bandung Conference, and Philly Panch (non-alcoholic).

About the Organizers: Gamming Collective is a group of educator-activists for Palestine committed to building Black-Asian solidarity through artful, politically engaged pop-up events in Philly.
