Join us for the launch and reading of “The Seeds This Soil Holds,” a photo and poetry zine by Keesean Moore. The zine combines a series of poems with historical imagery harvested from the John J. Wilcox Jr. Archives, and embraces an understanding of the self as a composite being through diligent memory work.

Keesean Moore is a poet, artist and the owner of The Moore Vintage Archive in Queen Village, Philadelphia, PA.
