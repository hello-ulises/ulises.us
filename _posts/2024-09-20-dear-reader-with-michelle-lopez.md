For this iteration of Dear Reader, join interdisciplinary artist, Michelle Lopez, in a conversation of Ken Lum’s Commodities reading list in relation to his work.

Dear Reader is a programmatic series that follows the model of an informal book club to delve into Ulises's quarterly reading lists through facilitated workshops, lectures, performances, and screenings.

[Michelle Lopez](https://www.michellelopez.com/ "https\://www.michellelopez.com/") is a sculptor and installation artist. As a builder, conceptualist, and manipulator of materials, Lopez inventively explores cultural phenomena, stretching to their limits multiple industrial processes. Lopez’s gimlet eye examines collapsed political and social structures by inverting cultural tropes through the process of building. Her installations—precarious assemblages of humble yet labor-intensive materials such as hand-twisted steel rope, pulled glass, bent wood, and street rubble—draw from the aesthetic languages and histories of industrialization, art movements, and the built environment to critique the ways in which dominant narratives, power, and authority shape space.

Lopez’s WHEN UNDER ONE SKY takes a similar approach and intervenes on the architectural site of North American Street through words. Recently installed onto the brick exterior of Ray Philly, the text-based public artwork employs language at the edge of the building to ruminate on the overarching sky as a future site of repair and collectivity.
