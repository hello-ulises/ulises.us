Representing Ulises for [Sci-Fi Sunday at the PMA](https://philamuseum.org/calendar/event/sci-fi-sunday-ulises), poet and artist Anaïs Duplan will share some of his favorite passages from Colson Whitehead’s The Intuitionist. The Sci-Fi Sunday reading series is in conjunction with the exhibition “Designs for Different Futures.”

[Anaïs Duplan](https://worksofanais.com/) is the founding curator for the Center for Afrofuturist Studies, an artist residency program for artists of color, based in Iowa City. He now works as Program Manager at Recess and Adjunct Assistant Professor in Poetry at Columbia University.

The Intuitionist concerns the travails of Lila Mae Watson, the first black woman elevator inspector in a New York-esque city. The novel seizes upon an unsung wonder in our midst, the elevator, and sings its history, its technology, its romance, adding to the novelist’s solid research a scintillating pinch of sci-fi fantasy. The extensive guild of metropolitan elevator inspectors is split, it would seem, between the Empiricists, who plod through their inspections one material criterion at a time, and the Intuitionists, who take a more mystical, gestalt approach to the detection of safety flaws.
