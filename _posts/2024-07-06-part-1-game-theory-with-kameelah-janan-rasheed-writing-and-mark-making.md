The day’s first program will focus on designing a series of writing and mark-making prompts. We will take inspiration from the Dadaists, OuLiPians, FLUXUS, and childhood language games. Once we have some context, all participants will be provided with the support and resources to design one prompt/game to be played later in the day. We will end the session by making a 1-sheet book so that participants will have descriptions of other prompts to take home.

* Make a chance-based writing game using chalk-drawn hopscotch.
* Design a writing prompt in which participants must write using something other than a pen, pencil, or other traditional writing tool.
* Create a mark-making prompt in which participants cannot use their hands.

Participants are encouraged to sign up for both sessions, but it is not required. 16+ and if younger, please arrive with a guardian. Eventbrite registration is appreciated.
