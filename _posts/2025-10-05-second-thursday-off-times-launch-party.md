Thursday, October 9, 6:00 – 9:00 PM, [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/second-thursday-off-times-launch-party-tickets-1751983292189?aff=oddtdtcreator)

The Alternative Art School (TAAS) presents the launch of the first edition of OFF-TIMES, based nowhere and everywhere.  

OFF-TIMES is a conceptual art newspaper and exhibition of nine artists in print! The project grew out of a class with [TAAS](https://thealternativeartschool.net/) founder Nato Thompson called ‘Let’s Make a Show.' Rooted in the Fluxus tradition, OFF-TIMES is an absurdist proposition, a critical reflection during an ‘off-time’, and a collaborative experiment in blurring fact, fiction, and logic. Artists include Erfan Ghiasi, Hilary Nylander, Julie Abijanac, Karen Dolmanisth, Kristin Bauer, Marcelino Stuhmer, Mariangeles Soto-Diaz, Maura Jasper, and Patrick Meagher. The artists are based in Tehran, Blue Ridge Mountains, Columbus, Arcadia Forest, San Francisco, Troy, and Los Angeles. Contributing artist Marcelino Stuhmer and managing editor Nato Thompson are both based in Philadelphia.\
