"I guess I’m never sure that print is truly linear." —Muriel Cooper

Muriel Cooper (1925–1994) was the pioneering designer who created the iconic MIT Press colophon (or logo)—seven bars that represent the lowercase letters “mitp” as abstracted books on a shelf. She designed a modernist monument, the encyclopedic volume The Bauhaus (1969), and the graphically dazzling and controversial first edition of Learning from Las Vegas (1972). She used an offset press as an artistic tool, worked with a large-format Polaroid camera, and had an early vision of e-books. More than two decades after her career came to a premature end, Muriel Cooper’s legacy is still unfolding.

[Mark Owens](http://www.lifeofthemind.net/) is a designer, writer, and curator working between New York, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. He holds an MFA in graphic design from Yale University and an MA in English and literary theory from Duke University. For the past decade he has worked as an independent graphic designer, primarily for publishers and clients in the cultural realm. He is co-editor with Zak Kyes of the catalogue for the exhibition Forms of Inquiry at the Architectural Association, London, and his essays have appeared in Dot Dot Dot, Visible Language, Grafik, PIN-UP, Bricks from the Kiln, and Experimental Jetset’s recent monograph, Statement and Counter-Statement.
