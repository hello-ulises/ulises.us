**[RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/luiso-ponce-brutalist-drawings-tickets-1299991602879?aff=oddtdtcreator)**

Stop by all weekend (April 12 & 13 from 12pm - 6pm) for a pop-up exhibition of Luiso Ponce’s latest ink work, *Brutalist Drawings*, curated by Ryan Allen Hancock.

Luiso Ponce is a self-taught Guatemalan multidisciplinary visual and sound artist living and working in Guatemala City. Ponce's work explores symbolism, information architecture, memory, and imagining new futures. Ponce's *Brutalist Drawings* explore the impact of excessive image, content, and information consumption as well as the stimulation and alienation they create in society.

Ponce's printer ink drawings are an effort to seek relief of this information saturation, by creating his own visual language, based upon symbols of the invented past to reimagine a new future. Ultimately allowing the viewer to supplant meaning to the images outside of known language.

Ponce’s work has been shown in [La Erre](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWOiXTGPDYJ/?img_index=10) (Guatemala City), [Houseguest](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCHXnJPvpKu/?img_index=6) (Guatemala City) and [SDE 911 / Material Art Fair](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3GB_y-MIkQ/)  (Tijuana, MX), as well as featured in [Terremoto Magazine](https://wordpress.terremoto.mx/etiqueta/luiso-ponce/) (MX)
