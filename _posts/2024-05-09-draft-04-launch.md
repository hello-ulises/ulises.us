**DRAFT 04 Launch**\
[RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/draft-04-launch-tickets-901562717357?aff=oddtdtcreator)

Join us for the launch of DRAFT 04, featuring [Tag Christof](https://www.tagchristof.com/), a New Mexican photographer who has been chasing Americana for over a decade now. His work focuses on the gritty imperfection that to him defines the texture of pre-digital American culture, which he grew up idolizing. These images were shot over a period of 5 years exploring the Southwest, both observing and participating in the culture.

This will be the fourth issue of DRAFT mag, a one-photographer-per-issue book that focuses on the process of unfinished or unseen projects of established artists. Each book contains an interview with the artist as well as 30-40 images. 

The books are published by [IOTA Editions](https://iota-editions.com/), organized by [Ian Loring Shiver](https://www.ianloringshiver.com/), and designed by [Nick Massarelli](https://nickmassarelli.com/). There will be shirts available made exclusively for the launch.
