Since 2012, Title has been a fixture in the Philadelphia art world as an unaffiliated platform for art writing. Beginning in 2017, they are establishing a new structure in pursuit of broader, more conceptually-driven goals for content. Title Magazine’s new editorial team — Lindsay Buchman, Samantha Mitchell, Kaitlin Pomerantz, Meredith Sellers, and Bailey Sheehan — invites you to join  in celebrating their relaunch at Ulises. Brunch cocktails and light snacks will be available!
