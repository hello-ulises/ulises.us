**[RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/book-launch-all-exits-a-collection-of-short-stories-tickets-913581215007?aff=oddtdtcreator)**

On this night almost one year ago a small and strange book was released to the public...Please join us on June 6 to celebrate the anniversary of *ALL EXITS*: a collection of short stories by Lane Timothy Speidel.

On this special night, invited artists including Anne Ishii, Blanche Brown, KT Pe Benito, Kim Altomare, and others will take turns interpreting the book and its stories.  We hope to see you for a night exploring raining clouds, flashlights in darkness, and secrets under skin. 

*ALL EXITS* contains observant aliens, ancient eels, missing cats, inter-dimensional doorways, and reflections that move on their own. Filled with insights and bizarre sensory description, decorated with charming illustrations and photographs of night, ALL EXITS is a little book that will walk through your mind like a mischievous cat - tipping over things you didn’t even know were there.

Also available to browse and purchase will be; Light Sleep: love poems written in between naps. A poetry zine about curiosity and surrender. Asking many questions, but ultimately willing to fall deeply in. There are sweet poems, silly ones, philosophical ones, and sexy ones. Wishing to question the boundaries of knowing, naming, sex, and both group and individual identity.
