This interactive info session explores intergenerational publishing and arts-based literacy with Citation Needed Press. Educators and families can learn about Citation Needed’s arts-based literacy approach and its library of all-ages publications.

The session will also introduce the upcoming Summer Printmaking Workshop and how participants’ work will be transformed into a collaborative publication. Attendees will have the opportunity to weigh in on the poetic theme of the workshop, ask questions, and provide community context.

Parents and teachers are encouraged to sign up! Seating is limited. **[RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/citation-needed-information-session-tickets-1303389817029?aff=oddtdtcreator)**
