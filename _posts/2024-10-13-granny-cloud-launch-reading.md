Launch Party and Reading for Farnoosh Fathi's "Granny Cloud" (NYRB Poets, 2024)\
Friday, October 18, from 7–9 PM. [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/launch-party-and-reading-for-farnoosh-fathis-granny-cloud-tickets-1036856314147?aff=oddtdtcreator)

Farnoosh Fathi will read from the collection and sign copies of "Granny Cloud," Fathi’s first collection in over a decade, iterations of lines tumble from poem to poem through repeated portraits of home and children, peas and baldness, worms, spiders, and snails that collect in a salivating cumulus of lyric reinvention. Fathi will be joined by Philadelphia poet Lena Rose Impellizzeri Weiss-Walker.
