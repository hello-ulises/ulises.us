Jenny Holzer wants to inspire people to register and vote; to help spread the word Holzer created a series of animations some of which you can [download here](https://egnyte.suttoncomms.com/fl/a58QLENKUd#folder-link/). Philly, we're in a swing state and October 19th is the last day to register in PA, so check your registration status and [plan your vote](https://www.youvote.vote/). Enough is enough!
