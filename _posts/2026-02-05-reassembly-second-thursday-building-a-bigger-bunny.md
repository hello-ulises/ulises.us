Thursday, February 12, 6pm - 9pm [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1982319803896?aff=oddtdtcreator)



This Second Thursday, Ulises and Reassembly exhibiting artist Ruth van Beek invite you to help us build an enormous rabbit.

Expanding upon van Beek’s Assembly submission, The Largest Rabbit (Assembly / Catalog No. 0085), has grown into a collaborative, wall-sized work. Visitors are encouraged to engage directly with her process by scanning copies of rabbits from van Beek’s archive, printing, cutting, and pasting them into a single, larger rabbit. 

Materials and warm beverages provided.
