From July 18 until July 27, Ulises will host *an oblique character,* a pop-up exhibition of works by Yale’s 2025 MFA Graphic Design cohort.

*an oblique character … in the form of a thin line that denotes alternatives or combinations between multiple words and concepts, moving uphill from the lower left corner to upper right with a left-to-right reading order, which may appear similar in italic and regular text.*

A forward slash, or oblique character, divides/links, separates/combines; it moves up/down, left/right—never fixed, always shifting. We are tilting between alternatives: caught between frameworks that circumscribe and support, hold and let go. We move between content and form, function and expression, order and fluidity, building structures that adjust/adapt/lean. This exhibition is an extension of that movement—a space that invites the viewer to adjust their perspective. Through leaning structures, obliqueforms, and moments of imbalance, we explore design as something that does not stand alone but finds its balance in relation to everything else.

​​The Yale graphic design program focuses on the development of a cohesive, investigative body of work, also known as the student’s thesis. At Yale, the graphic design thesis is conceived as a loose framework within which each student’s visual method is deployed across many diverse projects during the two-year course of study. While every thesis project is unique, there are several common features: a focus on methodology, the application of a visual method to studio work, and the organization of the work in a thoughtfully argued written document and “Thesis Book.”
