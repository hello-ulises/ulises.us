Join Ulises for the launch of *Carte Blanche*, a collaborative publication/exhibition project organized by the Printmaking graduate cohort at Tyler School of Art. Featuring the work of 22 artists, poets, and experimental cartographers with ties to Philadelphia, *Carte Blanche* explores the politics and poetics of mapping through print. The project, an edition of 40, reimagines landscapes and spatial narratives, challenging traditional cartographic frameworks by centering lived experiences, community resilience, and unseen stories.\

Participants from **Tyler School of Art** include: Sophia Dell’Arciprete, Amze Emmons, Rae Helms, Rylie Kelley, Francesca Lally, Jess Santana, Olivia Smith, Heather Swenson, and Corinne Teed, alongside invited **Philadelphia-based contributors**: Lindsay Buchman, CA Conrad, Matao Dreskin, Candy Gonzales, Kristen Neville-Taylor, José Ortiz Pagán, Jena Osman, Aislinn Pentecost-Farrin, Kaitlin Pomerantz, Heidi Ratanavanich, Tafari Robertson, Kate Van Vilet, and Ricky Yanas.
