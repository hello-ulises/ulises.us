**[RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/caicu-artist-talk-collective-memory-and-public-art-tickets-1299890239699?aff=oddtdtcreator)**

In partnership with Mural Arts Philadelphia and CAICU, Marángeli Mejía-Rabell, project curator, will lead a conversation with artists Celso Gonzalez, Angurria, Dan One, Calo Rosa, and the Taína Sisters about their soon-to-be-dedicated mural at Front & Susquehanna (formerly the Fine Fare Supermarket). The discussion will highlight the mural's inspiration and the team's efforts to honor the rich Caribbean heritage of the Norris Square community, our Kensington neighbors.

About CAICU: CAICU is a socially engaged public art and cultural organizing initiative led by Philadelphia-based curator Marángeli Mejía-Rabell and Puerto Rico-based muralist Celso Gonzalez. Focused on Norris Square (Philadelphia) and Loíza (Puerto Rico), the project responds to rapid real estate development and the displacement of Black and Latino/a/x communities. Through public art and cultural exchange, CAICU aims to strengthen community bonds and preserve neighborhood identity—continuing its work through the Summer of 2025.
