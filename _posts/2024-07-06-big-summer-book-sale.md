The third annual BIG SUMMER BOOK SALE will feature an eclectic mix of bookstores, print collectives, and artist-run projects — from comics to wearable multiples, from self-published zines to discounted art books (care of Ulises) — as we celebrate printed matter among friends and family, in its many popular, social, and liberatory forms. \
\
25 Philly-based vendors plus a few out-of-town guests will share their print wares on Sunday, July 14th from 11am – 5pm at Icebox Project Space (1400 N. American St). Hosted by[Ulises](https://www.ulises.us/), [Icebox Project Space](https://www.iceboxprojectspace.com/), and [FORTUNE](https://printingfortunes.info/)with support from Fire Museum Presents and Penn Treaty SSD. Cash bar, free hot dogs rolling (while supplies last), and a raffle every hour on the hour. \
